2.&nbsp;<em><span style='font-family:Roboto'>Declaration Of Policies</span></em>—</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(a) In the pursuit of an independent foreign policy and while
considering national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest and
the right to self-determination paramount in its relations with other states,
the State shall, at all times, uphold the dignity of its citizens whether in
country or overseas, in general, and Filipino migrant workers, in particular,
continuously monitor international conventions, adopt/be signatory to and
ratify those that guarantee protection to our migrant workers, and endeavor to
enter into bilateral agreements with countries hosting overseas Filipino
workers.</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(b) The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and
overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality
of employment opportunities for all. Towards this end, the State shall provide
adequate and timely social, economic and legal services to Filipino migrant
workers.</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(c) While recognizing the significant contribution of Filipino
migrant workers to the national economy through their foreign exchange
remittances, the State does not promote overseas employment as a means to
sustain economic growth and achieve national development. The existence of the
overseas employment program rests solely on the assurance that the dignity and
fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Filipino citizens shall not, at
any time, be compromised or violated. The State, therefore, shall continuously
create local employment opportunities and promote the equitable distribution of
wealth and the benefits of development.</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(d) The State affirms the fundamental equality before the law of
women and men and the significant role of women in nation-building. Recognizing
the contribution of overseas migrant women workers and their particular
vulnerabilities, the State shall apply gender sensitive criteria in the
formulation and implementation of policies and programs affecting migrant
workers and the composition of bodies tasked for the welfare of migrant
workers.</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(e) Free access to the courts and quasi-judicial bodies and
adequate legal assistance shall not be denied to any person by reason of
poverty. In this regard, it is imperative that an effective mechanism be
instituted to ensure that the rights and interest of distressed overseas
Filipinos, in general, and Filipino migrant workers, in particular, whether
regular/documented or irregular/undocumented, are adequately protected and
safeguarded. </span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(f) The right of Filipino migrant workers and all overseas
Filipinos to participate in the democratic decision-making processes of the
State and to be represented in institutions relevant to overseas employment is
recognized and guaranteed.</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(g) The State recognizes that the most effective tool for
empowerment is the possession of skills by migrant workers. The government
shall provide them free and accessible skills development and enhancement
programs. Pursuant to this and as soon as practicable, the government shall
deploy and/or allow the deployment only of skilled Filipino workers.</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(h) The State recognizes non-governmental organizations, trade
unions, workers associations, stakeholders and their similar entities duly
recognized as legitimate, are partners of the State in the protection of
Filipino migrant workers and in the promotion of their welfare. The State shall
cooperate with them in a spirit of trust and mutual respect. The significant
contribution of recruitment and manning agencies shall from part this
partnership.</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;
color:#444444'>(i) Government fees and other administrative costs of
recruitment, introduction, placement and assistance to migrant workers shall be
rendered free without prejudice to the provision of Section 36 hereof.</span></p>

            <p style='text-align:justify;background:white'><span style='font-family:Roboto;

whether land-based or sea-based by local service contractors and manning
agencies employing them shall be encouraged. Appropriate incentives may be
extended to them.</span></p>
