                        Act No. 7160 (<i>Local Government Code</i>) <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</b>, and <b>DELETES</b> the
                        phrase from Section 284. </p>
                        <p>Section 284, as hereby modified, shall henceforth read as follows: </p>
                        <p><b>Section 284.</b> <i>Allotment of Taxes.</i> &#8212; Local government units shall have a
                            share in the national taxes based on the collection of the third fiscal year preceding the

                        <p> Provided, That in the event that the national government incurs an unmanageable public

                            recommendation of Secretary of Finance, Secretary of Interior and Local Government and
                            Secretary of Budget and Management, and subject to consultation with the presiding officers
                            of both Houses of Congress and the presidents of the "liga," to make the necessary

                            preceding the current fiscal year; Provided, further, That in the first year of the
                            effectivity of this Code, the local government units shall, in addition to the thirty
                            percent (30%) allotment which shall include the cost of devolved functions for essential
                            public services, be entitled to receive the amount equivalent to the cost of devolved
                            personal services. </p>
                        <p> The phrase "internal revenue" is likewise hereby <b>DELETED</b> from the related sections of

                            and Section 290, which provisions shall henceforth read as follows: </p>

                        <p> Provided, further, That the share of each barangay with a population of not less than one
                            hundred (100) inhabitants shall not be less than Eighty thousand (P80,000.00) per annum
                            chargeable against the twenty percent (20%) share of the barangay from the allotment, and
                            the balance to be allocated on the basis of the following formula: </p>
                        <blockquote><p> (a) On the first year of the effectivity of this Code:</p>
                            <blockquote><p>(1) Population &#8212; Forty percent (40%); and</p>
                                <p> (2) Equal sharing &#8212; Sixty percent (60%) (b) </p></blockquote>
                            <p>On the second year: </p>
                            <blockquote><p>(1) Population &#8212; Fifty percent (50%); and</p>
                                <p> (2) Equal sharing &#8212; Fifty percent (50%)</p></blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p> Provided, finally, That the financial requirements of barangays created by local government
                            units after the effectivity of this Code shall be the responsibility of the local government

                <p> In substantiation, the OSG contends that the affected provisions of the Local Government Code (LGC)
                    are not contrary to Section 6, Article X of the Constitution, under which the plenary power of
                    Congress extends nut only to the determination of they<em> <i>just share</i></em> of local
                    government units (LGUs) but also to the determination of which national taxes serve as base for the
                    computation of such <i>just share</i>.</p>
                <p> The OSG premises its contention on the fact that the article "<em>the</em>" immediately precedes the
                    phrase "<em>national taxes</em>" in Section 6, thereby manifesting the intent to give Congress the
                    discretion to determine which national taxes the <i>just share</i> will be based on considering that
                    the qualifier "<em>the</em>" signals that the succeeding phrase "<em>national taxes</em>" is a
                    specific class of taxes; that if it was the intention of the framers to include <em>all</em>
                    national taxes, the Constitution should have so stated; that the phrase <em>internal revenue</em>
                    should be restored in the affected provisions of the LGC considering that the deletion of the phrase
                    constitutes an undue encroachment on the power of Congress to determine the LGUs' <i>just share</i>;
                    that the effect of broadening the base for computing the <i>just share</i> is to modify Congress'
                    internal revenue allocations (IRA) in favor of the LGUs, which the Court cannot do because imposing
                    the new base was not intended by Congress; that it is more prudent for the Court to nullify Section
                    284 of the LGC in its entirety and to allow Congress to make the necessary adjustments; that,
                    indeed, the Court, its awesome powers notwithstanding, cannot supplant Congress' discretion to
                    determine the amount of the <i>just share</i> the LGUs are entitled to; that certain taxes
                    (<em>i.e</em>., those under Republic Act No. 9054, Republic Act No. 6631, and Republic Act No. 6632)
                    that the Court has ordered to be included in the reckoning of the base amount of the fair share of
                    the LGUs should be excluded because including them will result to double sharing on the part of host
                    LGUs which are already given particular shares by virtue of the Court's directive to include in the
                    base the national government share; that the double sharing is not intended by Congress; that the
                    inclusion of the other taxes, particularly the taxes under Republic Act No. 7171 and Republic Act
                    No. 8240, the national taxes on utilization and development of the national wealth under Section 289
                    of the LGC, the value added tax (VAT) collections under Section 106, Section 108 and Section 116 of
                    the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) will deprive the National Government of much needed funds
                    for essential services; and that the collections of the Bureau of Customs should be excluded from
                    the base amount because of the nature of tariffs as being for the regulation of goods coming in and
                    going out of the country instead of being just for income generation.</p>
                <p> The OSG interposes that should the Court nonetheless affirm the decision of July 3, 2018, it should
                    expressly declare the effects of the decision to be prospective following the operative fact
                    doctrine, resulting in the base amount decreed herein to start only in Fiscal Year 2022.</p>
                <p> On his part, petitioner Garcia seeks partial reconsideration to pray that all the arrears from 1992
                    resulting from the new computation of the base amount of the fair share be given to the LGUs.<sup

                <p align="center"><b>Ruling of the Court</b></p>
                <p> The Court denies both motions for their lack of merit. </p>
                <p> In the July 3, 2018 decision, the Court has held that the Constitution itself set <em>national
                    taxes</em> as the base amount from which to reckon the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs, <i>viz</i>.:
                </p>
                <blockquote><p> Section 6, Article X the 1987 Constitution textually commands the allocation to the LGUs
                    of a <i>just share</i> in the national taxes, <em>viz</em>.:</p>
                    <blockquote><p> Section 6. Local government units shall have a <i>just share</i>, as determined by
                        law, in the national taxes which shall be automatically released to them.</p></blockquote>
                    <p> Section 6, when parsed, embodies three mandates, namely: (1) the LGUs shall have a <i>just
                        share</i> in the<em> national taxes</em>; (2) the <i>just share</i> shall be <em>determined by
                        law</em>; and (3) the <i>just share</i> shall be <em>automatically released</em> to the LGUs.
                    </p>
                    <p> Congress has sought to carry out the second mandate of Section 6 by enacting Section 284, Title
                        III (<em>Shares of Local Government Units in the Proceeds of National Taxes</em>), of the LGC,
                        which is again quoted for ready reference:</p>
                    <blockquote><p> Section 284. <i>Allotment of Internal Revenue Taxes</i>. &#8212; Local government
                        units shall have a share in the <b>national internal revenue taxes</b> based on the collection
                        of the third fiscal year preceding the current fiscal year as follows:</p>
                        <blockquote><p> (a) On the first year of the effectivity of this Code, thirty percent

                            <p> (c) On the third year and thereafter, forty percent (40%).</p></blockquote>
                        <p> Provided, That in the event that the national government incurs an unmanageable public
                            sector deficit, the President of the Philippines is hereby authorized, upon the

                            Secretary of Budget and Management, and subject to consultation with the presiding officers
                            of both Houses of Congress and the presidents of the "liga," to make the necessary
                            adjustments in the internal revenue allotment of local government units but in no case shall
                            the allotment be less than thirty percent (30%) of the collection of national internal
                            revenue taxes of the third fiscal year preceding the current fiscal year: Provided, further,
                            That in the first year of the effectivity of this Code, the local government units shall, in
                            addition to the thirty percent (30%) internal revenue allotment which shall include the cost
                            of devolved functions for essential public services, be entitled to receive the amount
                            equivalent to the cost of devolved personal services.</p></blockquote>
                    <p> There is no issue as to what constitutes the LGUs' <i>just share</i> expressed in percentages of
                        the national taxes (<em>i.e</em>., 30%, 35% and 40% stipulated in subparagraphs (a), (b), and
                        (c) of Section 284). Yet, Section 6, <em>supra</em>, mentions <em>national taxes</em> as the
                        source of the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs while Section 284 ordains that the share of the LGUs
                        be taken from <em>national internal revenue taxes</em> instead.</p>
                    <p> Has not Congress thereby infringed the constitutional provision? </p>
                    <p>Garcia contends that Congress has exceeded its constitutional boundary by limiting to the NIRTs
                        the base from which to compute the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs.</p>
                    <p> We agree with Garcia's contention.</p>
                    <p> Although the power of Congress to make laws is plenary in nature, congressional lawmaking
                        remains subject to the limitations stated in the 1987 Constitution. The phrase <em>national
                            internal revenue taxes</em> engrafted in Section 284 is undoubtedly more restrictive than
                        the term <em>national taxes</em> written in Section 6. As such, Congress has actually departed
                        from the letter of the 1987 Constitution stating that<em> national taxes</em> should be the base
                        from which the <i>just share</i> of the LGU comes. Such departure is impermissible.<em> Verba
                            legis non est recedendum</em> (from the words of a statute there should be no departure).
                        Equally impermissible is that Congress has also thereby curtailed the guarantee of fiscal
                        autonomy in favor of the LGUs under the 1987 Constitution.</p>
                    <p> Taxes are the enforced proportional contributions exacted by the State from persons and
                        properties pursuant to its sovereignty in order to support the Government and to defray all the
                        public needs. Every tax has three elements, namely: (a) it is an enforced proportional
                        contribution from persons and properties; (b) it is imposed by the State by virtue of its
                        sovereignty; and (c) it is levied for the support of the Government. Taxes are classified into
                        national and local. National taxes are those levied by the National Government, while local
                        taxes are those levied by the LGUs. </p>
                    <p> What the phrase<em> national internal revenue taxes</em> as used in Section 284 included are all
                        the taxes enumerated in Section 21 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended by
                        R.A. No. 8424, viz.: </p>
                    <blockquote><p> Section 21. <i>Sources of Revenue</i>. &#8212; The following taxes, fees and charges
                        are deemed to be national internal revenue taxes: </p>
                        <blockquote><p> (a) Income tax; </p>
                            <p>(b) Estate and donor's taxes; </p>
                            <p>(c) Value-added tax;</p>
                            <p> (d) Other percentage taxes;</p>
                            <p> (e) Excise taxes;</p>
                            <p> (f) Documentary stamp taxes; and </p>
                            <p>(g) Such other taxes as are or hereafter may be imposed and collected by the Bureau of
                                Internal Revenue. </p></blockquote>
                        <p> In view of the foregoing enumeration of what are the national internal revenue taxes,
                            Section 284 has effectively deprived the LGUs from deriving their <i>just share</i> from
                            <em>other</em> national taxes, like the customs duties. </p>
                        <p> Strictly speaking, customs duties are also taxes because they are exactions whose proceeds
                            become public funds. According to <em>Garcia v. Executive Secretary</em>, <em>customs
                                duties</em> is the nomenclature given to taxes imposed on the importation and
                            exportation of commodities and merchandise to or from a foreign country. Although customs
                            duties have either or both the generation of revenue and the regulation of economic or
                            social activity as their moving purposes, it is often difficult to say which of the two is
                            the principal objective in a particular instance, for, verily, customs duties, much like
                            internal revenue taxes, are rarely designed to achieve only one policy objective. We further
                            note that Section 102 (oo) of R.A. No. 10863 (<em>Customs Modernization and Tariff Act</em>)
                            expressly includes all fees and charges imposed under the Act under the blanket term of
                            taxes. </p>
                        <p> It is clear from the foregoing clarification that the exclusion of <em>other</em> national
                            taxes like customs duties from the base for determining the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs
                            contravened the express constitutional edict in Section 6, Article X the 1987 Constitution.
                        </p>
                        <p> Still, the OSG posits that Congress can manipulate, by law, the base of the allocation of
                            the just share in the national taxes of the LGUs. </p>
                        <p> The position of the OSG cannot be sustained. Although it has the primary discretion to
                            determine and fix the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs in the national taxes (e.g., Section 284
                            of the LGC), Congress cannot disobey the express mandate of Section 6, Article X of the 1987
                            Constitution for the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs to be derived from the <em>national
                                taxes</em>. The phrase <em>as determined by</em> law in Section 6 follows and qualifies
                            the phrase <i>just share</i>, and cannot be construed as qualifying the succeeding phrase
                            <em>in the national taxes</em>. The intent of the people in respect of Section 6 is really
                            that the base for reckoning the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs should includes all national
                            taxes. <b>To read Section 6 differently as requiring that the <i>just share</i> <em>of LGUs
                                in the national taxes shall be determined by law</em> is tantamount to the unauthorized
                                revision of the 1987 Constitution.</b> [Bold emphasis supplied; italicized portions are
                            part of the original text] </p></blockquote>
                </blockquote>
                <p> We reiterate that Congress, in limiting the base amount to<em> national internal revenue taxes</em>,
                    gravely abused its discretion. What the Constitution extended to Congress was the power to
                    determine, by law, the <i>just share</i>. The Constitution did not empower Congress to determine the
                    <i>just share</i> and the base amount other than national taxes. </p>
                <p> The respondents' construction of Section 6, Article X of the Constitution can lead to empowering
                    Congress to change the base amount despite the Constitution having already pegged it to <em>national
                        taxes</em>. We should remember that between two possible interpretations one of which will be
                    free from constitutional infirmity and the other tainted by such grave defect, the former is to be
                    preferred. A construction that will save rather than one that will affix the seal of doom certainly
                    commends itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Moreover, it is a rule in statutory
                    construction that every part of the law must be interpreted with reference to the context,<i>
                        i.e.</i>, every part of the law must be considered together with the other parts, and kept
                    subservient to the general intent of the whole enactment. The law must not be read in truncated
                    parts; its provisions must be read in relation to its entirety. The particular words, clauses and
                    phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated expressions, but the whole and every part of
                    the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a
                    harmonious whole.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Accordingly, between the Court's
                    construction that is consistent with the constitutional policy on local autonomy and
                    decentralization, on one hand, and the OSG's construction that seemingly rejects the constitutional
                    policy, the former is to be desired. </p>
                <p> Conformably with the foregoing, the Court sees no reason to exclude the national taxes mentioned in
                    the July 3, 2018 decision. Indeed, Section 6, Article X of the Constitution expressly states that
                    national taxes shall constitute the base amount from which the <i>just share</i> shall be computed.
                    Without the Constitution itself excluding such national taxes from the computation of the base
                    amount, the rule will be that such national taxes are to be included. This has been made clear in
                    the decision, where the Court explains - </p>
                <blockquote><p> Garcia submits that even assuming that the present version of Section 284 of the LGC is
                    constitutionally valid, the implementation thereof has been erroneous because Section 284 does not
                    authorize any exclusion or deduction from the collections of the NIRTs for purposes of the
                    computation of the allocations to the LGUs. He further submits that the exclusion of certain NIRTs
                    diminishes the fiscal autonomy granted to the LGUs. He claims that the following NIRTs have been

                        special purposes. A reading of Section 288 and Section 289 of the NIRC and Section 24 (3) of
                        P.D. No. 1445 in relation to Section 284 of the NIRC reveals that all such taxes are levied and
                        collected for a special purpose. The same is true for the franchise taxes paid under Section 6
                        of R.A. No. 6631 and Section 8 of R.A. No. 6632, inasmuch as certain percentages of the

                        VI of the 1987 Constitution, which states: </p>

                        different constitutional provision. Section 7, Article X of the 1987 Constitution allows
                        affected LGUs to have an equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization of the nation's
                        national wealth "within their respective areas," to wit: </p>

                        guaranteed by the 1987 Constitution. The mandate under Section 15 to Section 21, Article X of
                        the 1987 Constitution is to allow the separate development of peoples with distinctive cultures
                        and traditions in the autonomous areas. The grant of autonomy to the autonomous regions includes
                        the right of self-determination &#8212; which in turn ensures the right of the peoples residing
                        therein to the necessary level of autonomy that will guarantee the support of their own cultural
                        identities, the establishment of priorities by their respective communities' internal
                        decision-making processes and the management of collective matters by themselves. As such, the
                        NIRTs collected by the provinces and cities within the ARMM will ensure local autonomy and their

                <p> While the Court understands the financial implications that may result from the July 3, 2018
                    decision, it is not within the power of the Court to adjust the purportedly exorbitant rate of the
                    fair share of the LGUs. In striking down the affected provisions of the LGC, the Court is only
                    exercising and discharging its constitutional duty of judicial review. The duty does not allow the
                    Court to mark time and await the rectification to be made by Congress of the unconstitutional
                    situation, as the OSG seems to suggest, considering that the Court has to intervene and act once its
                    power of judicial review has been properly and duly invoked. </p>
                <p> Lastly, petitioner Garcia argues that because portions of Section 284 of the LGC are found and
                    declared to be unconstitutional, the LGUs are entitled to recover the arrears in their <i>just
                        share</i>. In contrast, the OSG wants the ruling to have a prospective application. </p>
                <p> Both positions have been fully considered and settled by the decision of July 3, 2018, as borne out
                    by the following excerpts of the relevant portions of the decision, <i>viz</i>.: </p>
                <blockquote><p> The petitioners' prayer for the payment of the arrears of the LGUs' <i>just share</i> on
                    the theory that the computation of the base amount had been unconstitutional all along cannot be
                    granted. </p>
                    <p> It is true that with our declaration today that the IRA is not in accordance with the
                        constitutional determination of the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs in the national taxes, logic
                        demands that the LGUs should receive the difference between the <i>just share</i> they should
                        have received had the LGC properly reckoned such <i>just share</i> from all national taxes, on
                        the one hand, and the share &#8212; represented by the IRA &#8212; the LGUs have actually
                        received since the effectivity of the IRA under the LGC, on the other. This puts the National
                        Government in arrears as to the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs. A legislative or executive act
                        declared void for being unconstitutional cannot give rise to any right or obligation. </p>
                    <p> Yet, the Court has conceded in <i>Araullo v. Aquino III</i> that: </p>
                    <blockquote><p>x x x <b>the generality of the rule makes us ponder whether rigidly applying the rule
                        may at times be impracticable or wasteful. Should we not recognize the need to except from the
                        rigid application of the rule the instances in which the void law or executive act produced an
                        almost irreversible result?</b></p>
                        <p><b>The need is answered by the doctrine of operative fact. </b>The doctrine, definitely not a
                            novel one, has been exhaustively explained in <i>De Agbayani v. Philippine National Bank</i>:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote><p> The decision now on appeal reflects the orthodox view that an unconstitutional
                            act, for that matter an executive order or a municipal ordinance likewise suffering from
                            that infirmity, cannot be the source of any legal rights or duties. Nor can it justify any
                            official act taken under it. Its repugnancy to the fundamental law once judicially declared
                            results in its being to all intents and purposes a mere scrap of paper. As the new Civil
                            Code puts it: 'When the courts declare a law to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the
                            former shall be void and the latter shall govern.' Administrative or executive acts, orders
                            and regulations shall be valid only when they are not contrary to the laws of the
                            Constitution. It is understandable why it should be so, the Constitution being supreme and
                            paramount. Any legislative or executive act contrary to its terms cannot survive. </p>
                            <p><b>Such a view has support in logic and possesses the merit of simplicity. It may not
                                however be sufficiently realistic. It does not admit of doubt that prior to the
                                declaration of nullity such challenged legislative or executive act must have been in
                                force and had to be complied with. </b><b>This is so as until after the judiciary, in an
                                appropriate case, declares its invalidity, it is entitled to obedience and respect.
                                Parties may have acted under it and may have changed their positions. What could be more
                                fitting than that in a subsequent litigation regard be had to what has been done while
                                such legislative or executive act was in operation and presumed to be valid in all
                                respects. It is now accepted as a doctrine that prior to its being nullified, its
                                existence as a fact must be reckoned with. This is merely to reflect awareness that
                                precisely because the judiciary is the governmental organ which has the final say on
                                whether or not a legislative or executive measure is valid, a period of time may have
                                elapsed before it can exercise the power of judicial review that may lead to a
                                declaration of nullity. It would be to deprive the law of its quality of fairness and
                                justice then, if there be no recognition of what had transpired prior to such
                                adjudication.</b></p>
                            <p> In the language of an American Supreme Court decision: 'The actual existence of a
                                statute, prior to such a determination [of unconstitutionality], is an operative fact
                                and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be
                                erased by a new judicial declaration. The effect of the subsequent ruling as to
                                invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects, with respect to particular
                                relations, individual and corporate, and particular conduct, private and official.'</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p><b>The doctrine of operative fact recognizes the existence of the law or executive act prior

                            the void law or executive act but sustains its effects. It provides an exception to the
                            general rule that a void or unconstitutional law produces no effect. </b>But its use must be
                            subjected to great scrutiny and circumspection, and it cannot be invoked to validate an
                            unconstitutional law or executive act, but is resorted to only as a matter of equity and
                            fair play. It applies only to cases where extraordinary circumstances exist, and only when
                            the extraordinary circumstances have met the stringent conditions that will permit its
                            application. </p></blockquote>
                    <p> Conformably with the foregoing pronouncements in <i>Araullo v. Aquino III</i>, the effect of our
                        declaration through this decision of the unconstitutionality of Section 284 of the LGC and its
                        related laws as far as they limited the source of the <i>just share</i> of the LGUs to the NIRTs
                        is prospective. It cannot be otherwise. (Bold underscoring is part of the original) </p>

                <p> As the foregoing excerpts indicate, the Court has expressly mandated the prospective application of
                    its ruling. </p>
                <p> It becomes unavoidable to ask when the adjusted amounts will be granted in favor of LGUs. The OSG
                    suggests that the adjusted amounts be given to the LGUs starting with the 2022 budget cycle. </p>
                <p> The suggestion of the OSG is well taken. </p>
                <p> The adjusted amounts can be deemed effective only after this ruling has lapsed into finality, which
                    is procedurally to be reckoned only from the denial of the OSG's motion for reconsideration through
                    this resolution. From then onwards, and as ruled herein, the just share should be based on all
                    national taxes collected on "the third fiscal year preceding." In the absence of any amendment by
                    Congress, the rates fixed in Section 284 of the LGC, as herein modified, shall control. </p>

                <p> First, Section 284<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Local Government Code, which
                    prescribed the "just share" to be 40% of the national internal revenue taxes, is a proper exercise
                    of legislative discretion accorded by the 1987 Constitution;<sup
                            style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and </p>
                <p>Second, the computation of the internal revenue allotment &#8212; which was approved and integrated
                    in the 2012 General Appropriations Act and which excluded from the base the: (1) value-added tax;
                    (2) excise tax; (3) documentary stamp taxes collected by the Bureau of Customs; and (4) certain
                    Bureau of Internal Revenue collections made under special laws &#8212; is not unconstitutional. </p>
                <p> The 1987 Constitution only requires that local government units should have a just share in the
                    national taxes. There are no restrictions on how their share should be determined other than that it
                    must be "just." The just share is to be determined "by law," a term which covers both the
                    Constitution and statutes. </p>
                <p> Congress, therefore, has full discretion to determine the just share of local government units, the
                    authority of which necessarily includes the power to fix or define what are included in the revenue
                    base and the rate for the computation of the internal revenue allotment. The phrase "national taxes"
                    is broad enough to give Congress a lot of leeway in determining what portion or what sources within
                    the national taxes should be the just share, taking into consideration the needs of local government
                    units <em>vis-a-vis</em> the limitations of the budget. </p>
                <p> A fundamental precept in constitutional litigation is the presumption that official acts of other
                    government branches are constitutional. This is premised on the theory that "before the act was done
                    or the law was enacted, earnest studies were made by Congress or the President, or both, to insure
                    that the Constitution would not be breached."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Without a
                    clear showing of breach of constitutional text, the validity of the Congress' and the President's
                    determination of the just share of local government units must be sustained.</p>
                <p align="center"><b>I</b></p>
                <p> Under Section 284 of the Local Government Code, Congress determined the just share as 40% of
                    national internal revenue taxes. I agree with the Office of the Solicitor General's contention that
                    we cannot simply disregard the phrase "internal revenue" in Section 284, since Congress fixed the
                    rate of 40% using "national internal revenue taxes" as the base.</p>
                <p> The simple deletion of the phrase "internal revenue" would effectively broaden the allocation for
                    local government units to a ratio that was not intended by Congress. This would constitute an undue
                    encroachment on its legislative prerogative to determine the just share of local government
                    units.</p>
                <p> This Court cannot read Section 284 on a piecemeal basis. The phrase "40% of national internal
                    revenue taxes" should be read in its entirety as constituting Congress' determination of the just
                    share of the local government units in the national taxes. Otherwise stated, the "just share in the
                    national taxes" has been determined by Congress to be "40% of national internal revenue taxes." </p>
                <p> To further illustrate, since the just share represents a part of the whole, it is essentially a
                    "fraction." </p>
                <p> Let us assume that the "national taxes" (NT) represents one (1) whole pie. National internal revenue
                    taxes (NIRT) is a part of the pie. Let us say, it is 3/4 of the pie: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <blockquote><p> NIRT = 3/4 NT<br> 40% in fraction form is 2/5</p></blockquote>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <blockquote><p> 2/5 NIRT = 2/5 x (3/4 NT) <br> 2/5 NIRT = 3/10 NT<br> 40% NIRT = 30% NT</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
                <p> Following the assumption that the NIRT is equal to 3/4 of the NT, this would mean that "40% of
                    national internal revenue taxes" is actually an amount equivalent to "30% of national taxes."
                    Therefore, if we use "national taxes" as base, the <i>just share</i> as determined by Congress would
                    not be 40%, but "30% of the national taxes." </p>

                <p> The just share of local government units is integrated as the internal revenue allotment in the
                    General Appropriations Act. Like any other law, the General Appropriations Act is a product of
                    deliberations in the legislature. It is a special law pertaining specifically to appropriations of
                    money from the public treasury. </p>
                <p> Every appropriation is a political act. Allocating funds for programs, projects, and activities is
                    closely related to making political decisions. This may be gleaned from the entire government's
                    budgetary and appropriation process, as I have discussed in my earlier dissent: </p>
                <blockquote><p> The first phase in the process is the budget preparation. The Executive prepares a
                    National Budget that is reflective of national objectives, strategies, and plans for the following
                    fiscal year. Under Executive Order No. 292 of the Administrative Code of 1987, the national budget
                    is to be "formulated within the context of a regionalized government structure and of the totality
                    of revenues and other receipts, expenditures and borrowings of all levels of government and of
                    government-owned or controlled corporations." </p>
                    <p> The budget may include the following: </p>

                    <p>The President, in accordance with Article VII, Section 22 of the Constitution, submits the budget
                        of expenditures and sources of financing, which is also called the National Expenditure Plan, to
                        Congress as the basis of the general appropriation bill, which will be discussed, debated on,
                        and voted upon by Congress. Also included in the budget submission are the proposed expenditure
                        levels of the Legislative and Judicial Branches, and of Constitutional bodies. </p>
                    <p> All appropriation proposals must be included in the budget preparation process. Congress then
                        "deliberates or acts on the budget proposals . . . in the exercise of its own judgment and
                        wisdom [and] formulates an appropriation act." The Constitution states that "Congress may not
                        increase the appropriations recommended by the President for the operation of the Government as
                        specified in the budget." Furthermore, "all expenditures for (1) personnel retirement premiums,
                        government service insurance, and other similar fixed expenditures, (2) principal and interest
                        on public debt, (3) national government guarantees of obligations which are drawn upon, are
                        automatically appropriated."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p></blockquote>
                <p> Once the appropriation bill is passed, Congress sends it to the President for his or her
                    approval.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Under the Constitution, the President is
                    allowed to either approve it or veto any item without affecting its other provisions.<sup
                            style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> "This function enables the President to remove any
                    item of appropriation, which in his or her opinion, is wasteful or unnecessary."<sup
                            style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p>
                <p> Therefore, we can presume that the executive branch and Congress have prudently determined the level
                    of expenditures to be funded from anticipated revenues based on the historical performance of
                    economic conditions, as well as their projections for the incoming year. The determination of the
                    just share under Article X, Section 6<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the 1987
                    Constitution is part of this process. </p>
                <p> By the very essence of how the appropriations for the national budget are passed into law&#8212;particularly
                    for this case, the 2012 General Appropriations Act&#8212;it can be presumed that Congress has "<i>purposefully,
                        deliberately, and precisely</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> approved the
                    revenue base, including the exclusions, for the internal revenue allotment.</p>
                <p align="center"><b>III</b></p>
                <p> A basic rule in statutory construction is that between a specific law and a general law, the former
                    must prevail. This is because a special law reveals the legislative intent more clearly than a
                    general law does.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Hence, the special law should be
                    deemed an exception to the general law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
                <p> The General Appropriations Act is a special law that outlines the share in the national fund of all
                    branches of government, including local government units. On the other hand, the National Internal
                    Revenue Code is a general law on taxation that applies to all persons. </p>
                <p> Being a specific law on appropriations, the General Appropriations Act should be an exception to the
                    National Internal Revenue Code's definition of national internal revenue taxes, as far as the
                    internal revenue allotments of local government units are concerned. The 2012 General Appropriations
                    Act is the clear and specific expression of legislative will&#8212;that the local government units'
                    internal revenue allotment is 40% of national internal revenue taxes, excluding tax collections of
                    the Bureau of Customs&#8212;and must be given effect. This was Congress' obvious intent, as can be
                    gleaned from all the general appropriation laws from 1992 to 2011, when Congress had adopted and
                    approved internal revenue allotments using the same revenue base.</p>
                <p> Congress' and the President's interpretation or determination of <i>just share</i> is neither absurd
                    nor odious, and well within the text of the Constitution. We should exercise deference to their
                    interpretation of what constitutes the just share of local government units. Absent any clear and

                <p> In <i>People v. Vera</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> then Associate Justice Jose
                    Laurel expounded on the rationale for this presumption in favor of constitutionality and the
                    corresponding restraint on our part: </p>
                <blockquote><p> This court is not unmindful of the fundamental criteria in cases of this nature that <b><i>all
                    reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a statute. An act of the
                    legislature approved by the executive, is presumed to be within constitutional limitations. </i></b>The
                    responsibility of upholding the Constitution rests not on the courts alone but on the legislature as
                    well. "The question of the validity of every statute is first determined by the legislative
                    department of the government itself." . . . And a statute finally comes before the courts sustained
                    by the sanction of the executive. <i>The members of the Legislature and the Chief Executive have
                        taken an oath to support the Constitution and it must be presumed that they have been true to
                        this oath and that in enacting and sanctioning a particular law they did not intend to violate
                        the Constitution. <b>The courts cannot but cautiously exercise its power to overturn the solemn
                            declarations of two of the three grand departments of the government.</b></i> . . . Then,
                    <i>there is that peculiar political philosophy which bids the judiciary to reflect the wisdom of the
                        people as expressed through an elective Legislature and an elective Chief Executive. It follows,
                        therefore, that the courts will not set aside a law as violative of the Constitution except in a
                        clear case.</i> This is a proposition too plain to require a citation of authorities.<sup
