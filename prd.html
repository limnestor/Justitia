Hearing before a referee may be held at any convenient place within the province or city as may be fixed by him and after reasonable notice thereof shall have been served the parties concerned. The court may render judgment in accordance with the report as though the facts have been found by the judge himself: Provided, however, that the court may in its discretion accept the report, or set it aside in whole or in part, or order the case to be recommitted for further proceedings:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 28. </strong><em>Partial judgment. </em>In a case where only a portion of the land subject of registration is contested, the court may render partial judgment provided that a subdivision plan showing the contested and uncontested portions approved by the Director of Lands is previously submitted to said court.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 29. </strong><em>Judgment confirming title. </em>All conflicting claims of ownership and interest in the land subject of the application shall be determined by the court. If the court, after considering the evidence and the reports of the Commissioner of Land Registration and the Director of Lands, finds that the applicant or the oppositor has sufficient title proper for registration, judgment shall be rendered confirming the title of the applicant, or the oppositor, to the land or portions thereof.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 31. </strong><em>Decree of registration. </em>Every decree of registration issued by the Commissioner shall bear the date, hour and minute of its entry, and shall be signed by him. It shall state whether the owner is married or unmarried, and if married, the name of the husband or wife: Provided, however, that if the land adjudicated by the court is conjugal property, the decree shall be issued in the name of both spouses. If the owner is under disability, it shall state the nature of disability, and if a minor, his age. It shall contain a description of the land as finally determined by the court, and shall set forth the estate of the owner, and also, in such manner as to show their relative priorities, all particular estates, mortgages, easements, liens, attachments, and other encumbrances, including rights of tenant-farmers, if any, to which the land or owner&#8217;s estate is subject, as well as any other matters properly to be determined in pursuance of this Decree.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The decree of registration shall bind the land and quiet title thereto, subject only to such exceptions or liens as may be provided by law. It shall be conclusive upon and against all persons, including the National Government and all branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the application or notice, the same being included in the general description &#8220;To all whom it may concern&#8221;.</p>

Whenever the phrase &#8220;innocent purchaser for value&#8221; or an equivalent phrase occurs in this Decree, it shall be deemed to include an innocent lessee, mortgagee, or other encumbrancer for value.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Upon the expiration of said period of one year, the decree of registration and the certificate of title issued shall become incontrovertible. Any person aggrieved by such decree of registration in any case may pursue his remedy by action for damages against the applicant or any other persons responsible for the fraud.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 33. </strong>Appeal from judgment, etc. The judgment and orders of the court hearing the land registration case are appealable to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court in the same manner as in ordinary actions:</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">(b) Thereupon, the Director of Lands shall give notice to persons claiming any interest in the lands as well as to the general public, of the day on which such survey will begin, giving as fully and accurately as possible the description of the lands to be surveyed. Such notice shall be punished once in the Official Gazette, and a copy of the notice in English or the national language shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the bulletin board of the municipal building of the municipality in which the lands or any portion thereof is situated. A copy of the notice shall also be sent to the mayor of such municipality as well as to the barangay captain and likewise to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and the Sangguniang Bayan concerned.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">(c) The Geodetic Engineers or other employees of the Bureau of Lands in charge of the survey shall give notice reasonably in advance of the date on which the survey of any portion of such lands is to begin, which notice shall be posted in the bulletin board of the municipal building of the municipality or barrio in which the lands are situated, and shall mark the boundaries of the lands by monuments set up in proper places thereon. It shall be lawful for such Geodetic Engineers and other employees to enter upon the lands whenever necessary for the purposes of such survey or the placing of monuments.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">(d) It shall be the duty of every person claiming an interest in the lands to be surveyed, or in any parcel thereof, to communicate with the Geodetic Engineer upon his request therefor all information possessed by such person concerning the boundary lines of any lands to which he claims title or in which he claims any interest.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">(e) Any person who shall willfully obstruct the making of any survey undertaken by the Bureau of Lands or by a licensed Geodetic Engineer duly authorized to conduct the survey under this Section, or shall maliciously interfere with the placing of any monument or remove such monument, or shall destroy or remove any notice of survey posted on the land pursuant to law, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand pesos or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.</p>
            <p><strong>B. PETITION; LOT NUMBERS</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 36. </strong><em>Petition for registration. </em>When the lands have been surveyed or plotted, the Director of Lands, represented by the Solicitor General, shall institute original registration proceedings by filing the necessary petition in the Court of First Instance of the place where the land is situated against the holders, claimants, possessors, or occupants of such lands or any part thereof, stating in substance that public interest requires that the title to such lands be settled and adjudicated and praying that such titles be so settled and adjudicated:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The petition shall contain a description of the lands and shall be accompanied by a plan thereof, and may contain such other data as may serve to furnish full notice to the occupants of the lands and to all persons who may claim any right or interest therein.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Where the land consists of two or more parcels held or occupied by different persons, the plan shall indicate the boundaries or limits of the various parcels as accurately as possible. The parcels shall be known as &#8220;lots&#8221; and shall on the plan filed in the case be given separate numbers by the Director of Lands, which numbers shall be known as &#8220;cadastral lot numbers&#8221;. The lots situated within each municipality shall, as far as practicable, be numbered consecutively beginning with number &#8220;one&#8221;, and only one series of numbers shall be used for that purpose in each municipality. However in cities or townsites, a designation of the landholdings by blocks and lot numbers may be employed instead of the designation by cadastral lot numbers.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The cadastral number of a lot shall not be changed after final decision has been entered decreasing the registration thereof, except by order of court. Future subdivisions of any lot shall be designated by a letter or letters of the alphabet added to the cadastral number of the lot to which the respective subdivisions pertain. The letter with which a subdivision is designated shall be known as its &#8220;cadastral letter&#8221;: Provided, however, that the subdivisions of cities or townsites may be designated by blocks and lot numbers.</p>

If two or more persons are registered owners, one owner&#8217;s duplicate certificate may be issued for the whole land, or if the co-owners so desire, a separate duplicate may be issued to each of them in like form, but all outstanding certificates of title so issued shall be surrendered whenever the Register of Deeds shall register any subsequent voluntary transaction affecting the whole land or part thereof or any interest therein. The Register of Deeds shall note on each certificate of title a statement as to whom a copy thereof was issued.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 42. </strong><em>Registration Books. </em>The original copy of the original certificate of title shall be filed in the Registry of Deeds.

Unpaid real estate taxes levied and assessed within two years immediately preceding the acquisition of any right over the land by an innocent purchaser for value, without prejudice to the right of the government to collect taxes payable before that period from the delinquent taxpayer alone.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Third. Any public highway or private way established or recognized by law, or any government irrigation canal or lateral thereof, if the certificate of title does not state that the boundaries of such highway or irrigation canal or lateral thereof have been determined.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 46. </strong><em>General incidents of registered land. </em>Registered land shall be subject to such burdens and incidents as may arise by operation of law. Nothing contained in this decree shall in any way be construed to relieve registered land or the owners thereof from any rights incident to the relation of husband and wife, landlord and tenant, or from liability to attachment or levy on execution, or from liability to any lien of any description established by law on the land and the buildings thereon, or on the interest of the owner in such land or buildings, or to change the laws of descent, or the rights of partition between co-owners, or the right to take the same by eminent domain, or to relieve such land from liability to be recovered by an assignee in insolvency or trustee in bankcruptcy under the laws relative to preferences, or to change or affect in any way other rights or liabilities created by law and applicable to unregistered land, except as otherwise provided in this Decree.</p>

A registered owner of several distinct parcels of land covered by separate certificates of title desiring to have in lieu thereof a single certificate for the whole land, or several certificates for the different parcels thereof, may also file a written request with the Register of Deeds concerned, and the latter, upon the surrender of the owner&#8217;s duplicates, shall cancel them together with their originals, and issue in lieu thereof one or separate certificates as desired.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 50. </strong><em>Subdivision and consolidation plans. </em>Any owner subdividing a tract of registered land into lots which do not constitute a subdivision project has defined and provided for under P.D. No. 957, shall file with the Commissioner of Land Registration or with the Bureau of Lands a subdivision plan of such land on which all boundaries, streets, passageways and waterways, if any, shall be distinctly and accurately delineated.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">If a subdivision plan, be it simple or complex, duly approved by the Commissioner of Land Registration or the Bureau of Lands together with the approved technical descriptions and the corresponding owner&#8217;s duplicate certificate of title is presented for registration, the Register of Deeds shall, without requiring further court approval of said plan, register the same in accordance with the provisions of the Land Registration Act, as amended: Provided, however, that the Register of Deeds shall annotate on the new certificate of title covering the street, passageway or open space, a memorandum to the effect that except by way of donation in favor of the national government, province, city or municipality, no portion of any street, passageway, waterway or open space so delineated on the plan shall be closed or otherwise disposed of by the registered owner without the approval of the Court of First Instance of the province or city in which the land is situated.</p>

Upon the surrender of the owner&#8217;s duplicate certificates and the receipt of consolidation plan duty approved by the Commission, the Register of Deeds concerned shall cancel the corresponding certificates of title and issue a new one for the consolidated lots.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Commission may not order or cause any change, modification, or amendment in the contents of any certificate of title, or of any decree or plan, including the technical description therein, covering any real property registered under the Torrens system, nor order the cancellation of the said certificate of title and the issuance of a new one which would result in the enlargement of the area covered by the certificate of title.</p>

                SUBSEQUENT REGISTRATION</strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>I<br />
                VOLUNTARY DEALINGS WITH REGISTERED LANDS</strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 51. </strong><em>Conveyance and other dealings by registered owner. </em>An owner of registered land may convey, mortgage, lease, charge or otherwise deal with the same in accordance with existing laws. He may use such forms of deeds, mortgages, leases or other voluntary instruments as are sufficient in law. But no deed, mortgage, lease, or other voluntary instrument, except a will purporting to convey or affect registered land shall take effect as a conveyance or bind the land, but shall operate only as a contract between the parties and as evidence of authority to the Register of Deeds to make registration.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The act of registration shall be the operative act to convey or affect the land insofar as third persons are concerned, and in all cases under this Decree, the registration shall be made in the office of the Register of Deeds for the province or city where the land lies.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 52. </strong><em>Constructive notice upon registration. </em>Every conveyance, mortgage, lease, lien, attachment, order, judgment, instrument or entry affecting registered land shall, if registered, filed or entered in the office of the Register of Deeds for the province or city where the land to which it relates lies, be constructive notice to all persons from the time of such registering, filing or entering.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 53. </strong><em>Presentation of owner&#8217;s duplicate upon entry of new certificate. </em>No voluntary instrument shall be registered by the Register of Deeds, unless the owner&#8217;s duplicate certificate is presented with such instrument, except in cases expressly provided for in this Decree or upon order of the court, for cause shown.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The production of the owner&#8217;s duplicate certificate, whenever any voluntary instrument is presented for registration, shall be conclusive authority from the registered owner to the Register of Deeds to enter a new certificate or to make a memorandum of registration in accordance with such instrument, and the new certificate or memorandum shall be binding upon the registered owner and upon all persons claiming under him, in favor of every purchaser for value and in good faith.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In all cases of registration procured by fraud, the owner may pursue all his legal and equitable remedies against the parties to such fraud without prejudice, however, to the rights of any innocent holder for value of a certificate of title. After the entry of the decree of registration on the original petition or application, any subsequent registration procured by the presentation of a forged duplicate certificate of title, or a forged deed or other instrument, shall be null and void.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 54. </strong><em>Dealings less than ownership, how registered. </em>No new certificate shall be entered or issued pursuant to any instrument which does not divest the ownership or title from the owner or from the transferee of the registered owners. All interests in registered land less than ownership shall be registered by filing with the Register of Deeds the instrument which creates or transfers or claims such interests and by a brief memorandum thereof made by the Register of Deeds upon the certificate of title, and signed by him. A similar memorandum shall also be made on the owner&#8217;s duplicate. The cancellation or extinguishment of such interests shall be registered in the same manner.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 55. </strong><em>Grantee&#8217;s name, nationality, etc., to be stated. </em>Every deed or other voluntary instrument presented for registration shall contain or have endorsed upon it the full name, nationality, residence and postal address of the grantee or other person acquiring or claiming an interest under such instrument, and every deed shall also state whether the grantee is married or unmarried, and if married, the name in full of the husband or wife. If the grantee is a corporation or association, the instrument must contain a recital to show that such corporation or association is legally qualified to acquire private lands. Any change in the residence or postal address of such person shall be endorsed by the Register of Deeds on the original copy of the corresponding certificate of title, upon receiving a sworn statement of such change. All names and addresses shall also be entered on all certificates.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Notices and processed issued in relation to registered land in pursuance of this Decree may be served upon any person in interest by mailing the same to the addresses given, and shall be binding, whether such person resides within or without the Philippines, but the court may, in its discretion, require further or other notice to be given in any case, if in its opinion the interest of justice so requires.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 56. </strong><em>Primary Entry Book; fees; certified copies. </em>Each Register of Deeds shall keep a primary entry book in which, upon payment of the entry fee, he shall enter, in the order of their reception, all instruments including copies of writs and processes filed with him relating to registered land. He shall, as a preliminary process in registration, note in such book the date, hour and minute of reception of all instruments, in the order in which they were received. They shall be regarded as registered from the time so noted, and the memorandum of each instrument, when made on the certificate of title to which it refers, shall bear the same date: Provided, that the national government as well as the provincial and city governments shall be exempt from the payment of such fees in advance in order to be entitled to entry and registration.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Every deed or other instrument, whether voluntary or involuntary, so filed with the Register of Deeds shall be numbered and indexed and endorsed with a reference to the proper certificate of title. All records and papers relative to registered land in the office of the Register of Deeds shall be open to the public in the same manner as court records, subject to such reasonable regulations as the Register of Deeds, under the direction of the Commissioner of Land Registration, may prescribe.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">All deeds and voluntary instruments shall be presented with their respective copies and shall be attested and sealed by the Register of Deeds, endorsed with the file number, and copies may be delivered to the person presenting them.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Certified copies of all instruments filed and registered may also be obtained from the Register of Deeds upon payment of the prescribed fees.</p>
            <p><strong>(A) CONVEYANCES AND TRANSFERS</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 57. </strong><em>Procedure in registration of conveyances. </em>An owner desiring to convey his registered land in fee simple shall execute and register a deed of conveyance in a form sufficient in law. The Register of Deeds shall thereafter make out in the registration book a new certificate of title to the grantee and shall prepare and deliver to him an owner&#8217;s duplicate certificate. The Register of Deeds shall note upon the original and duplicate certificate the date of transfer, the volume and page of the registration book in which the new certificate is registered and a reference by number to the last preceding certificate. The original and the owner&#8217;s duplicate of the grantor&#8217;s certificate shall be stamped &#8220;canceled&#8221;. The deed of conveyance shall be filled and indorsed with the number and the place of registration of the certificate of title of the land conveyed.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 58. </strong><em>Procedure where conveyance involves portion of land. </em>If a deed or conveyance is for a part only of the land described in a certificate of title, the Register of Deeds shall not enter any transfer certificate to the grantee until a plan of such land showing all the portions or lots into which it has been subdivided and the corresponding technical descriptions shall have been verified and approved pursuant to Section 50 of this Decree. Meanwhile, such deed may only be annotated by way of memorandum upon the grantor&#8217;s certificate of title, original and duplicate, said memorandum to serve as a notice to third persons of the fact that certain unsegregated portion of the land described therein has been conveyed, and every certificate with such memorandum shall be effectual for the purpose of showing the grantee&#8217;s title to the portion conveyed to him, pending the actual issuance of the corresponding certificate in his name.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Upon the approval of the plan and technical descriptions, the original of the plan, together with a certified copy of the technical descriptions shall be filed with the Register of Deeds for annotation in the corresponding certificate of title and thereupon said officer shall issue a new certificate of title to the grantee for the portion conveyed, and at the same time cancel the grantor&#8217;s certificate partially with respect only to said portion conveyed, or, if the grantor so desires, his certificate may be canceled totally and a new one issued to him describing therein the remaining portion: Provided, however, that pending approval of said plan, no further registration or annotation of any subsequent deed or other voluntary instrument involving the unsegregated portion conveyed shall be effected by the Register of Deeds, except where such unsegregated portion was purchased from the Government or any of its instrumentalities. If the land has been subdivided into several lots, designated by numbers or letters, the Register of Deeds may, if desired by the grantor, instead of canceling the latter&#8217;s certificate and issuing a new one to the same for the remaining unconveyed lots, enter on said certificate and on its owner&#8217;s duplicate a memorandum of such deed of conveyance and of the issuance of the transfer certificate to the grantee for the lot or lots thus conveyed, and that the grantor&#8217;s certificate is canceled as to such lot or lots.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 59. </strong><em>Carry over of encumbrances. </em>If, at the time of any transfer, subsisting encumbrances or annotations appear in the registration book, they shall be carried over and stated in the new certificate or certificates; except so far as they may be simultaneously released or discharged.</p>
            <p><strong>(B) MORTGAGES AND LEASES</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 60. </strong><em>Mortgage or lease of registered land. </em>Mortgage and leases shall be registered in the manner provided in Section 54 of this Decree. The owner of registered land may mortgage or lease it by executing the deed in a form sufficient in law. Such deed of mortgage or lease and all instruments which assign, extend, discharge or otherwise deal with the mortgage or lease shall be registered, and shall take effect upon the title only from time of registration.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">No mortgagee&#8217;s or lessee&#8217;s duplicate certificate of title shall hereafter be issued by the Registers of Deeds, and those issued prior to the effectivity of this Decree are hereby deemed canceled and the holders thereof shall immediately surrender the same to the Register of Deeds concerned.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 61. </strong><em>Registration. </em>Upon presentation for registration of the deed of mortgage or lease together with the owner&#8217;s duplicate, the Register of Deeds shall enter upon the original of the certificate of title and also upon the owner&#8217;s duplicate certificate a memorandum thereof, the date and time of filing and the file number assigned to the deed, and shall sign the said memorandum. He shall also note on the deed the date and time of filing and a reference to the volume and page of the registration book in which it is registered.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 62. </strong><em>Discharge or cancellation. </em>A mortgage or lease on registered land may be discharge or canceled by means of an instrument executed by the mortgage or lessee in a form sufficient in law, which shall be filed with the Register of Deeds who shall make the appropriate memorandum upon the certificate of title.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 63. </strong><em>Foreclosure of Mortgage. </em>(a) If the mortgage was foreclosed judicially, a certified copy of the final order of the court confirming the sale shall be registered with the Register of Deeds. If no right of redemption exists, the certificate of title of the mortgagor shall be canceled, and a new certificate issued in the name of the purchaser.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Where the right of redemption exists, the certificate of title of the mortgagor shall not be canceled, but the certificate of sale and the order confirming the sale shall be registered by a brief memorandum thereof made by the Register of Deeds upon the certificate of title. In the event the property is redeemed, the certificate or deed of redemption shall be filed with the Register of Deeds, and a brief memorandum thereof shall be made by the Register of Deeds on the certificate of title of the mortgagor.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">If the property is not redeemed, the final deed of sale executed by the sheriff in favor of the purchaser at a foreclosure sale shall be registered with the Register of Deeds; whereupon the title of the mortgagor shall be canceled, and a new certificate issued in the name of the purchaser.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) If the mortgage was foreclosed extrajudicially, a certificate of sale executed by the officer who conducted the sale shall be filed with the Register of Deeds who shall make a brief memorandum thereof on the certificate of title.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the event of redemption by the mortgagor, the same rule provided for in the second paragraph of this section shall apply.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In case of non-redemption, the purchaser at foreclosure sale shall file with the Register of Deeds, either a final deed of sale executed by the person authorized by virtue of the power of attorney embodied in the deed of mortgage, or his sworn statement attesting to the fact of non-redemption; whereupon, the Register of Deeds shall issue a new certificate in favor of the purchaser after the owner&#8217;s duplicate of the certificate has been previously delivered and canceled.</p>
            <p><strong>(C) POWERS OF ATTORNEY; TRUSTS</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 64. </strong><em>Power of attorney. </em>Any person may, by power of attorney, convey or otherwise deal with registered land and the same shall be registered with the Register of Deeds of the province or city where the land lies. Any instrument revoking such power of attorney shall be registered in like manner.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 65. </strong><em>Trusts in registered land. </em>If a deed or other instrument is filed in order to transfer registered land in trust, or upon any equitable condition or limitation expressed therein, or to create or declare a trust or other equitable interests in such land without transfer, the particulars of the trust, condition, limitation or other equitable interest shall not be entered on the certificate; but only a memorandum thereof shall be entered by the words &#8220;in trust&#8221;, or &#8220;upon condition&#8221;, or other apt words, and by a reference by number to the instrument authorizing or creating the same. A similar memorandum shall be made upon the original instrument creating or declaring the trust or other equitable interest with a reference by number to the certificate of title to which it relates and to the volume and page in the registration book in which it is registered.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 66. </strong><em>Trust with power of sale, etc., how expressed. </em>If the instrument creating or declaring a trust or other equitable interest contains an express power to sell, mortgage or deal with the land in any manner, such power shall be stated in the certificate of title by the words &#8220;with power to sell&#8221;, or &#8220;power to mortgage&#8221;, or by apt words of description in case of other powers. No instrument which transfers, mortgages or in any way deals with registered land in trust shall be registered, unless the enabling power thereto is expressly conferred in the trust instrument, or unless a final judgment or order of a court of competent jurisdiction has construed the instrument in favor of the power, in which case a certified copy of such judgment or order may be registered.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 67. </strong><em>Judicial appointment of new trustee. </em>If a new trustee of registered land is appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, a new certificate may be issued to him upon presentation to the Register of Deeds of a certified copy of the order or judicial appointment and the surrender for cancellation of the duplicate certificate.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 68. </strong><em>Implied, trusts, how established. </em>Whoever claims an interest in registered land by reason of any implied or constructive trust shall file for registration with the Register of Deeds a sworn statement thereof containing a description of the land, the name of the registered owner and a reference to the number of the certificate of title. Such claim shall not affect the title of a purchaser for value and in good faith before its registration.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>II<br />
                INVOLUNTARY DEALINGS</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 69. </strong><em>Attachments. </em>An attachment, or a copy of any writ, order or process issued by a court of record, intended to create or preserve any lien, status, right, or attachment upon registered land, shall be filed and registered in the Registry of Deeds for the province or city in which the land lies, and, in addition to the particulars required in such papers for registration, shall contain a reference to the number of the certificate of title to be affected and the registered owner or owners thereof, and also if the attachment, order, process or lien is not claimed on all the land in any certificate of title a description sufficiently accurate for identification of the land or interest intended to be affected. A restraining order, injunction or mandamus issued by the court shall be entered and registered on the certificate of title affected, free of charge.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 70. </strong><em>Adverse claim. </em>Whoever claims any part or interest in registered land adverse to the registered owner, arising subsequent to the date of the original registration, may, if no other provision is made in this Decree for registering the same, make a statement in writing setting forth fully his alleged right or interest, and how or under whom acquired, a reference to the number of the certificate of title of the registered owner, the name of the registered owner, and a description of the land in which the right or interest is claimed.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The statement shall be signed and sworn to, and shall state the adverse claimant&#8217;s residence, and a place at which all notices may be served upon him. This statement shall be entitled to registration as an adverse claim on the certificate of title. The adverse claim shall be effective for a period of thirty days from the date of registration. After the lapse of said period, the annotation of adverse claim may be canceled upon filing of a verified petition therefor by the party in interest: Provided, however, that after cancellation, no second adverse claim based on the same ground shall be registered by the same claimant.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Before the lapse of thirty days aforesaid, any party in interest may file a petition in the Court of First Instance where the land is situated for the cancellation of the adverse claim, and the court shall grant a speedy hearing upon the question of the validity of such adverse claim, and shall render judgment as may be just and equitable. If the adverse claim is adjudged to be invalid, the registration thereof shall be ordered canceled. If, in any case, the court, after notice and hearing, shall find that the adverse claim thus registered was frivolous, it may fine the claimant in an amount not less than one thousand pesos nor more than five thousand pesos, in its discretion. Before the lapse of thirty days, the claimant may withdraw his adverse claim by filing with the Register of Deeds a sworn petition to that effect.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 71. </strong><em>Surrender of certificate in involuntary dealings. </em>If an attachment or other lien in the nature of involuntary dealing in registered land is registered, and the duplicate certificate is not presented at the time of registration, the Register of Deeds shall, within thirty-six hours thereafter, send notice by mail to the registered owner, stating that such paper has been registered, and requesting him to send or produce his duplicate certificate so that a memorandum of the attachment or other lien may be made thereon. If the owner neglects or refuses to comply within a reasonable time, the Register of Deeds shall report the matter to the court, and it shall, after notice, enter an order to the owner, to produce his certificate at a time and place named therein, and may enforce the order by suitable process.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 72. </strong>Dissolution, etc. of attachments, etc. Attachments and liens of every description upon registered land shall be continued, reduced, discharged and dissolved by any method sufficient in law, and to give effect to the continuance, reduction, discharge or dissolution thereof the certificate or other instrument for that purpose shall be registered with the Register of Deeds.</p>

                ASSURANCE FUND</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 93. </strong><em>Contribution to Assurance Fund. </em>Upon the entry of a certificate of title in the name of the registered owner, and also upon the original registration on the certificate of title of a building or other improvements on the land covered by said certificate, as well as upon the entry of a certificate pursuant to any subsequent transfer of registered land, there shall be paid to the Register of Deeds one-fourth of one per cent of the assessed value of the real estate on the basis of the last assessment for taxation purposes, as contribution to the Assurance Fund. Where the land involved has not yet been assessed for taxation, its value for purposes of this decree shall be determined by the sworn declaration of two disinterested persons to the effect that the value fixed by them is to their knowledge, a fair valuation.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing in this section shall in any way preclude the court from increasing the valuation of the property should it appear during the hearing that the value stated is too small.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 94. </strong><em>Custody and investment of fund. </em>All money received by the Register of Deeds under the preceding section shall be paid to the National Treasurer. He shall keep this money in an Assurance Fund which may be invested in the manner and form authorized by law, and shall report annually to the Commissioner of the Budget the condition and income thereof.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The income of the Assurance Fund shall be added to the principal until said fund amounts to five hundred thousand pesos, in which event the excess income from investments as well as from the collections of such fund shall be paid into the National Treasury to the account of the Assurance Fund.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 96. </strong><em>Against whom action filed. </em>If such action is brought to recover for loss or damage or for deprivation of land or of any estate or interest therein arising wholly through fraud, negligence, omission, mistake or misfeasance of the court personnel, Register of Deeds, his deputy, or other employees of the Registry in the performance of their respective duties, the action shall be brought against the Register of Deeds of the province or city where the land is situated and the National Treasurer as defendants. But if such action is brought to recover for loss or damage or for deprivation of land or of any interest therein arising through fraud, negligence, omission, mistake or misfeasance of person other than court personnel, the Register of Deeds, his deputy or other employees of the Registry, such action shall be brought against the Register of Deeds, the National Treasurer and other person or persons, as co-defendants. It shall be the duty of the Solicitor General in person or by representative to appear and to defend all such suits with the aid of the fiscal of the province or city where the land lies: Provided, however, that nothing in this Decree shall be construed to deprive the plaintiff of any right of action which he may have against any person for such loss or damage or deprivation without joining the National Treasurer as party defendant. In every action filed against the Assurance Fund, the court shall consider the report of the Commissioner of Land Registration.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 97. </strong><em>Judgment, how satisfied. </em>If there are defendants other than the National Treasurer and the Register of Deeds and judgment is entered for the plaintiff and against the National Treasury, the Register of Deeds and any of the other defendants, execution shall first issue against such defendants other than the National and the Register of Deeds. If the execution is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, and the officer returning the same certificates that the amount due cannot be collected from the land or personal property of such other defendants, only then shall the court, upon proper showing, order the amount of the execution and costs, or so much thereof as remains unpaid, to be paid by the National treasurer out of the Assurance Fund. In an action under this Decree, the plaintiff cannot recover as compensation more than the fair market value of the land at the time he suffered the loss, damage, or deprivation thereof.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 98. </strong><em>General Fund when liable. </em>If at any time the Assurance Fund is not sufficient to satisfy such judgment, the National Treasurer shall make up for the deficiency from any funds available in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 99. </strong><em>Subrogation of government to plaintiff&#8217;s rights. </em>In every case where payment has been made by the National Treasurer in accordance with the provisions of this Decree, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines shall be subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff against any other parties or securities. The National Treasurer shall enforce said rights and the amount recovered shall be paid to the account of the Assurance Fund.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 100. </strong><em>Register of Deeds as party in interest. </em>When it appears that the Assurance Fund may be liable for damages that may be incurred due to the unlawful or erroneous issuance of a certificate of title, the Register of Deeds concerned shall be deemed a proper party in interest who shall, upon authority of the Commissioner of Land Registration, file the necessary action in court to annul or amend the title.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The court may order the Register of Deeds to amend or cancel a certificate of title or to do any other act as may be just and equitable.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 101. </strong><em>Losses not recoverable. </em>The Assurance Fund shall not be liable for any loss, damage or deprivation caused or occasioned by a breach of trust, whether express, implied or constructive or by any mistake in the resurveyed or subdivision of registered land resulting in the expansion of area in the certificate of title.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 102. </strong><em>Limitation of Action. </em>Any action for compensation against the Assurance Fund by reason of any loss, damage or deprivation of land or any interest therein shall be instituted within a period of six years from the time the right to bring such action first occurred: Provided, That the right of action herein provided shall survive to the legal representative of the person sustaining loss or damage, unless barred in his lifetime; and Provided, further, That if at the time such right of action first accrued the person entitled to bring such action was a minor or insane or imprisoned, or otherwise under legal disability, such person or anyone claiming from, by or under him may bring the proper action at any time within two years after such disability has been removed, notwithstanding the expiration of the original period of six years first above provided.</p>

It shall be the duty of the official issuing the instrument of alienation, grant, patent or conveyance in behalf of the Government to cause such instrument to be filed with the Register of Deeds of the province or city where the land lies, and to be there registered like other deeds and conveyance, whereupon a certificate of title shall be entered as in other cases of registered land, and an owner&#8217;s duplicate issued to the grantee. The deed, grant, patent or instrument of conveyance from the Government to the grantee shall not take effect as a conveyance or bind the land but shall operate only as a contract between the Government and the grantee and as evidence of authority to the Register of Deeds to make registration. It is the act of registration that shall be the operative act to affect and convey the land, and in all cases under this Decree, registration shall be made in the office of the Register of Deeds of the province or city where the land lies. The fees for registration shall be paid by the grantee. After due registration and issuance of the certificate of title, such land shall be deemed to be registered land to all intents and purposes under this Decree.</p>
