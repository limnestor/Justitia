Seen through the lens of the national policy of enabling alternatives to dispute resolution, the Court here takes a second look at judicial review and the specific mandate and authority of the CIAC, with the end of tracing how the extent of the former's reach over the latter, or the understanding thereof, has evolved over the years. </p><p> As will be seen in the succeeding discussions, the historical arc of this relationship appears to maintain the early, original legislative intent of judicial restraint in favor of the empowerment of arbitration. More particularly, a historical survey informs the Court of the intent of affording parties with a direct recourse to this Court in challenging a CIAC arbitral award on pure questions of law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> or one where only the application of the law as to uncontroverted facts is raised, which, under CIAC's original charter, and apart from the most excepting of circumstances, are the only questions that may be raised against it. </p><p> <i>Original and Affirmed Intent of E.O. 1008</i></p><p> The construction industry, in and of itself wrought with factual complexity, is not a stranger to the industry-specific arbitration. In its international history, as early as the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the peculiar intricacies of the construction processes and contracts have led to the call for industry-focused dispute resolution that implored professional decision-making and arbitration mechanisms.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> In the Philippines, the birth of construction arbitration can be traced back to the issuance of Presidential Decree No. (P.D.) 1746,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which created the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP). Recognizing the need to provide a national environment conducive for its expansion, P.D. 1746 was issued to address the then non-cohesive government policies by providing a central agency tasked to accelerate as well as regulate the growth of the industry.</p><p> On February 4, 1985, with the growth of the construction industry in full swing, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued E.O. 1008 which created the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) as the arbitration machinery for the Philippine construction industry. Its policy sought to ensure "early and expeditious settlement of disputes" in order to provide stability for its enterprises, and fairly insulate them from bureaucratic lags.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Its whereas clause<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> clearly provided for the law's resolve to remove the disputes of the industry from the languid and problematic machinery of the courts, with the full awareness that disputes held up in the judiciary's dockets easily translated to infrastructure projects that halted to a standstill. </p><p> The law likewise designed the CIAC awards to be decisive and conclusive, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 19. <u>Finality of Awards</u>. - The arbitral award shall be binding upon the parties. It shall be final and [u]nappealable except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court. </p> <p> SECTION 20. <u>Execution and Enforcement of Awards</u>. As soon as a decision, order or award has become final and executory, the Arbitral Tribunal or the single arbitrator, with the concurrence of the CIAC, shall [<i>motu proprio</i>] or on motion of any interested party, issue a writ of execution requiring any sheriff or other proper officer to execute said decision, order or award. </p> </blockquote> <p> Section 19 of the CIAC Charter provides that findings of fact of the CIAC are no longer open to challenge on appeal, but its legal conclusions may be assailed before the Court. This narrow corridor of remedies against a CIAC award as categorically provided for in its Charter was broadened by two succeeding procedural rules which significantly altered the review mode of a CIAC award, with the final sum a scenario akin to procedural laws defeating specialized substantive law and its inceptive spirit. </p><p><i>Procedural Departures: <br> Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 and<br> Rule 43 of 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</i> </p> <p>The first procedural law which effectively expanded the reach of judicial review <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> CIAC arbitral awards is Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> issued for the Court by then Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa on May 16, 1995, which amended Circular No. 1-91 and prescribed the rules governing appeals to the CA from final orders or decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals and quasi-judicial agencies. For the first time, the CIAC was included in the enumeration of quasi-judicial agencies, the decisions of which may be appealed to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This inclusion is the first clear departure from E.O. 1008's original provision that a CIAC arbitral award may only be appealed to this Court. Further, Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 also substantially extended judicial review powers in its categorical inclusion of questions of fact as those that may be appealed, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> 3. <i>WHERE TO APPEAL</i>. &#8212; An appear under these rules may be taken to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the manner herein provided, whether the appeal involves <b>questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law</b>. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> This procedural expansion was affirmed by the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, particularly Rule 43 thereof,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> which once more included the CIAC as among the quasi-judicial agencies the decisions of which may be appealed to the CA with respect to either points of fact, or law, or both. </p><p> In retrospect, what may be gleaned is that the enabling of the CA to review questions of fact pertaining to the CIAC awards departed from E.O. 1008's original design of the relationship between the courts and the CIAC, when it created the latter. In effect, the authoritative expertise of the CIAC was undone with these two new procedural changes because with the CA's power to review the arbitral tribunal's factual determinations, the CA then acts as a trial court, before which factual assertions already threshed out in the CIAC are litigated anew. Needless to say, one may be reasonably hard-pressed to find sound basis for a court's exercise of reviewing a specialized tribunal's findings of fact that are well within its specialized competence and well-outside the court's. </p><p> More so, such a factual review easily runs the peril of being speculative, as it overly extends the review powers that may invite ridicule upon the courts, which are forced to venture into industry-specific technical findings that they are not designed to do. </p><p> To be sure, the Court dispels with utmost import any conclusion to the effect that upholding the CIAC's authoritative expertise on questions of facts before it necessarily translates to even the slightest implication of inadequacy of intelligence or inferiority of competence on the part of appellate judges. This inference is as unintended as it is unsupported by the succeeding exhaustive discussion of the history and the constitutional schema within which this particular mode of review is found. </p><p> The Court's iteration of the original limits set upon judicial review of the CIAC arbitral awards must not be considered impertinence against appellate judges, lest all rulings that delineate limits be seen as a put-down of the competence of the jurisdiction they confine. The Court here simply upholds the persuasive weight of factual findings of the CIAC, and consequently rules against a factual judicial review that effectively undermines the CIAC's conclusive and authoritative findings, consistent with the prevailing laws as outlined. </p><p> It further goes without saying that appellate judges are fully equipped to conduct factual review by evaluating whether or not factual findings of lower courts or tribunals are supported by evidence. This fact is affirmed not in the least by the fact that in the event that a factual review of the CIAC arbitral awards is merited in the narrowest of sense, the same may be brought before the CA through the appropriate petition. Demonstratively, therefore, the CA is ultimately not divested of any review powers that it was not intended to wield, to begin with, but merely donned with the authority of review of the CIAC arbitral awards that falls within the original extent of E.O. 1008. </p><p> Finally, this factual review of the courts also weighs heavily in costs for the parties, in that instead of having an abridged resolution of their disputes, the same is, in fact, lengthened, with resort to the CIAC becoming no more than an additional layer in the process, and its resolution of construction disputes no longer the alternative to litigation, but only the beginning.</p><p> <i>Substantive Realignment towards <br> Deference to CIAC: <br> R.A. 9285 and the Special ADR Rules</i> </p><p> Significantly, however, on July 28, 2003, this departure would be unequivocally corrected and realigned with the passing of R.A. 9285,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> also known as the Alternative Dispute Resolution Law of 2004. Preliminarily, telling are the exchanges during the deliberations of the House Committee on Justice of its provisions. Then deliberated as House Bill 5654, its records reflected the legislative desire to provide alternative modes of dispute resolution in order to provide dispute settlement machineries that are far removed from notoriously cumbersome judicial mechanisms, in order, for one, to decongest the courts' dockets: </p><blockquote> <p> THE CHAIRMAN [(Rep. Marcelino C. Libanan)]: x x x x</p> <p> x x x I think from the Philippine Judicial Academy who raised the issue on separation of powers.

ANTONIO M. MARTINEZ (Vice Chancellor, Philippine Judicial Academy): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p> <p> Just like Atty.

It is really a laudable piece of legislation and would, in effect, be a very helpful device to decongest the courts of [their] clogged dockets.</p> <p>x x x x</p> <p> As a matter of fact, recently, we launched the mediation project in the appellate level. We hope that in due time, we will be able to eventually saturate all of the courts nationwide with mediators and will be able to help us in decongesting the clogged docket of court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> R.A. 9285 was also designed to draw a broad and bright line between litigation and alternative resolutions of disputes, as was shown by the comment of the head of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators: </p><blockquote> <p> MR. MARIO VALDERAMA (Representative, Chartered Institute of Arbitrators): Thank you, Your Honor. </p> <p> Now, now to go directly to the point, when we talked about ADR, Your Honor, please, we talk about party autonomy and of course the promotion of ADR is only the means resulting to the effect, among them, the declogging of courts, and probably, we can do something about the declaration of policy instead of promoting, merely promoting ADR, then probably, <b>what would have to be upheld would be the autonomy of the parties insofar as their dispute resolution is concerned</b>. The thinking being that... since we are adults, with sufficient discretion, then we may... <b>we should have the option of choosing whether to go to litigation or to go ADR</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Consistent with the above rationale for demarcating options for parties in dispute, as well as relieving the courts of the workload that may no longer necessitate litigation, Sections 34-40, Chapter 6 of R.A. 9285, on the governing laws over construction disputes, distinctly resolved all doubts in favor of the restrictive limitation of judicial review only to questions of law, and a categorical deference to the CIAC with respect to its findings of fact. </p><p> First, Section 34 positively provided for the return to E.O. 1008, as the original applicable law, which in turn rules out judicial review of the CIAC's factual determination, and exclusively provides that appeal may only be to the Court, and on the narrow limit of questions of law only: </p><blockquote> <p> <b><i>SEC. 34. Arbitration of Construction Disputes: Governing Law.</i></b> - The arbitration of construction disputes shall be governed by Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction Industry Arbitration Law. </p> </blockquote> <p> Second, evidencing the legislative intent to defer the threshing of facts to the CIAC and not the courts, Section 39 likewise fittingly provides that in the event that a trial court is notified of a construction arbitration clause between parties who are litigating before it, the court is bound to dismiss the case, unless the parties agree to the contrary: </p><blockquote> <p> <b><i>SEC. 39. Court to Dismiss Case Involving a Construction Dispute.</i></b> - A regional trial court where a construction dispute is filed shall, upon becoming aware, not later than the pretrial conference, that the parties had entered into an arbitration to be conducted by the CIAC, unless both parties, assisted by their respective counsel, shall submit to the regional trial court a written agreement exclusive for the Court, rather than the CIAC, to resolve the dispute. </p> </blockquote> <p> Finally, on September 1, 2009, for the avoidance of uncertainties as to where the line of review is drawn, the Supreme Court, through Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno, issued Administrative Matter No. (A.M) 7-11-08-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> also known as the Special ADR Rules, which definitively affirmed the bright-line rule on judicial restraint with regard to factual review. Undeniably clear are Rule 19.7 and 19.10 of the Special ADR Rules, which provide: </p><p align="center"> <b>PART VI</b></p><p align="center"> <b>RULE 19: MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, APPEAL AND<br> CERTIORARI</b> </p><p align="center"> x x x x </p><blockquote> <p> <b>B.

The vital role of the neutral expertise of the arbitral tribunal in such disputes has been underscored in a 2011 New York State Bar Report on the advantages of arbitration in the field of construction: </p><blockquote> <p> In arbitration, the experienced construction neutral requires much less "setting the stage" for the context of the dispute. He or she will understand substantive case law in the area, for instance case law regarding change orders, betterment, "quantum meruit" claims and other specialties of construction law. These concepts will not be "new" to the arbitrator so while time may be spent on describing the application of these laws to the particular case, the arbitrator will not need to be introduced to the concepts.</p> <p> An experienced construction arbitrator will also have the ability to understand complex construction disputes on a technical level. Construction disputes are usually resolved on the facts and the contract. In cases that haven't settled, there is often a disagreement on the facts and the contract. Was there a material delay by the engineer in approving shop drawings? Were the shop drawings complete? Do the disputed Change Orders actually represent work outside the scope of the contract? Were proper procedures followed during drilling? Does the contract promise payment for unanticipated sub-surface site conditions or not? Experienced arbitrators frequently commiserate that attorneys inexperienced in arbitration often spend their time proving the filings of character or ethics in the participants, while neglecting to address that which every arbitrator cares about, the facts and the contract. Construction cases do not deserve to be settled on emotion, but rather on a matrix of complex facts and contractual responsibilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In related fashion, several notable decisions have illustrated how CIAC awards serve the premium of persuasive factual determination, but are nevertheless not insulated from judicial review on grounds that go into the integrity of the arbitral tribunal.</p><p> In <i>Metropolitan Cebu Water District v. Mactan Rock Industries, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court repeated the early recognition of the peculiar nature of the construction industry as one that is considered "x x x vital for the fulfilment of national development goals x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and the corresponding need to have its disputes decided with dispatch. In similar import, in <i>R.V. Santos Company, Inc. v. Belle Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the Court expounded on the deference to the factual findings of the CIAC, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 19 [of E.O. 1008] makes it crystal clear that questions of fact cannot be raised in proceedings before the Supreme Court &#8212; which is not a trier of facts &#8212; in respect of an arbitral award rendered under the aegis of the CIAC. <b>Consideration of the animating purpose of voluntary arbitration in general, and arbitration under the aegis of the CIAC in particular, requires us to apply rigorously the above principle embodied in Section 19 that the Arbitral Tribunal's findings of fact shall be final and [u]nappealable.</b></p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private purposes. <b>The Court will not review the factual findings of an arbitral tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had "misapprehended the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as "legal questions["]</b>. The parties here had recourse to arbitration and chose the arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in such arbitrators. <b>The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued before the Arbitral Tribunal, save only where a very clear showing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of jurisdiction. <u>Prototypical examples would be factual conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the other party of a fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through fraud or the corruption of arbitrators. Any other, more relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration and would reduce arbitration to a largely inutile institution.</u></b> </p> <p> In another case, we have also held that: </p> <p> It is settled that <b>findings of fact of <i>quasi</i>-judicial bodies, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect</b>, but also finality, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals. In particular, factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and conclusive and not reviewable by this Court on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In 2015, in <i>Philippine Race Horse Trainer's Association, Inc. v. Piedras Negras Construction and Development Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the Court found that the matters the parties brought for resolution essentially required factual determination, which it held must "rightly be left to the CIAC's sound expertise."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Subsequently, in the case of <i>Fruehauf Electronics Philippines Corporation v. Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the Court upheld the autonomy of arbitral awards, and refrained from reviewing factual findings thereof, reasoning thus: </p><blockquote> <p> We have deliberately refrained from passing upon the merits of the arbitral award &#8212; not because the award was erroneous &#8212; but because it would be improper. None of the grounds to vacate an arbitral award are present in this case and as already established, the merits of the award cannot be reviewed by the courts.</p> <p> Our refusal to review the award is not a simple matter of putting procedural technicalities over the substantive merits of a case; it goes into the very legal substance of the issues. There is no law granting the judiciary authority to review the merits of an arbitral award. If we were to insist on reviewing the correctness of the award (<i>or consent to the CA's doing so</i>), it would be tantamount to expanding our jurisdiction without the benefit of legislation. This translates to judicial legislation &#8212; a breach of the fundamental principle of separation of powers.</p> <p> <b>The CA reversed the arbitral award &#8212; <i>an action that it has no power to do</i> &#8212; because it disagreed with the tribunal's factual findings and application of the law. </b>However, the alleged incorrectness of the award is insufficient cause to vacate the award, given the <b>State's policy of upholding the autonomy of arbitral awards</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> More, in <i>CE Construction Corporation v. Araneta Center, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the Court was similarly inclined to refrain from reviewing the CIAC's factual conclusions, ruling in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x When their awards become the subject of judicial review, courts must defer to the factual findings borne by arbitral tribunals' technical expertise and irreplaceable experience of presiding over the arbitral process. Exceptions may be availing but only in instances when the integrity of the arbitral tribunal itself has been put in jeopardy. These grounds are more exceptional than those which are regularly sanctioned in Rule 45 petitions.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> The CIAC does not only serve the interest of speedy dispute resolution, it also facilitates <i>authoritative</i> <b>dispute resolution. Its authority proceeds not only from juridical legitimacy but equally from technical expertise. The creation of a special adjudicatory body for construction disputes presupposes distinctive and nuanced competence on matters that are conceded to be outside the innate expertise of regular courts and adjudicatory bodies concerned with other specialized fields. </b>The CIAC has the state's confidence concerning the entire technical expanse of construction, defined in jurisprudence as "referring to all on-site works on buildings or altering structures, from land clearance through completion including excavation, erection and assembly and installation of components and equipment." </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> This is not to say that factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may now be assailed before the Court of Appeals. Section 3's statement "whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law" merely recognizes variances in the disparate modes of appeal that Rule 43 standardizes: there were those that enabled questions of fact; there were those that enabled questions of law, and there were those that enabled mixed questions fact and law. Rule 43 emphasizes that though there may have been variances, all appeals under its scope are to be brought before the Court of Appeals. <b>However, in keeping with</b> <b>the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, any appeal from CIAC arbitral tribunals must remain limited to questions of law.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In his <i>Concurring Opinion</i>, Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen (Justice Leonen) adds on the rationale for the high degree of deference accorded to CIAC awards, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> The CIAC serves the interest not only of speedy dispute resolution, but also of <i>authoritative</i> dispute resolution.

The 2019 case of Tondo Medical Center v. Rante<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> illustrates: </p><blockquote> <p> Thus, questions on <b>whether the CIAC arbitral tribunals conducted their affairs in a haphazard and immodest manner that the most basic integrity of the arbitral process was imperiled</b> are not insulated from judicial review. Thus: </p> <blockquote> <p> x x x We reiterate the rule that <b>factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and conclusive and not reviewable by this Court on appeal, except when the petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under section nine of Republic Act No. 876 and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.</b> x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In other words, the scenarios that will trigger a factual review of the CIAC's arbitral award must fall within either of the following sets of grounds: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"><b>Challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal</b> (<i>i.e</i>., (i) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (ii) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (iii) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (iv) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under <u>Section 9 of R.A. 876</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> or "The Arbitration Law", and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (v) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made) and; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Allegation of the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law.</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>In addition to the prototypical examples that exceptionally trigger a factual review of the CIAC's arbitral awards, the Court here discerns the merit in adding the otherwise forgotten presumption that factual findings of the CIAC arbitral tribunal may also be revisited by the Court upon an allegation that the arbitral tribunal committed an act that is violative of the Constitution or other positive laws. To abate fears, the delimitation discerned in the Court's power to review factual findings of the CIAC shall in no way plausibly allow for a situation wherein the Court's hand is stayed from correcting a blatant constitutional or legal violation because the autonomy of the arbitral process is paramount. Contrarily, the Court underscores that the contracted or very limited grounds for alleging grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CIAC arbitral tribunal, however narrow, are still principally tethered to the courts' primary duty of upholding the Constitution and positive laws. The addition of the second ground makes plain that no amount of contracting or expanding grounds for grave abuse will ever be permitted to lay waste to the original purpose of the courts and their mandate to uphold the rule of law. </p> <p> Given the above Court pronouncements on judicial restraint in favor of animating and upholding the autonomy of the CIAC, as well as the more reasonable exceptions that all only involve a determination of whether the arbitral award in question was tainted with a challenge on the integrity of the arbitrators themselves or otherwise a violation of the Constitution or positive law in the course of the arbitral process, the Court deems it high time to revisit prior decisions that include among the exceptions meriting a factual review the mere disagreement of the factual findings of the CA <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those made by the CIAC, as in the oft-cited case of <i>Uniwide Sales Realty and Resources Corporation v. Titan-Ikeda Construction and Development Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and the more recent case of <i>Shangri-La Properties, Inc. v. B.F. Corporation</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> </p><p> All told, the Court must now, sitting <em>en banc</em>, inescapably re-weigh the applicable laws and harmonize them in order to make the pertinent rules consistent with the spirit of the law that gave form to the CIAC, along with the overriding and uncontroverted national policy of favoring the unfettered and enabled operations of the alternative modes of resolutions such as the CIAC. </p><p> <b><i>II - Mode of Appeal of CIAC awards vis-&agrave;-vis Constitutional Limitations</i></b> </p><p> Unmistakably, the tracing of the evolution of laws relating to judicial review of the CIAC awards as shown above demonstrates that the mode of appeal of the CIAC awards exists within a latticework of constitutional licenses and restraints. These constitutional parameters converge on three key points: (1) the prescriptive apportionment' of the powers and appellate jurisdictions of both the CA and the Court, (2) the correlated limitation on the Congress' power to determine and confer a court's jurisdiction, and (3) the limitations on the Court's rule-making power. These constitutional conditions bear upon the ultimate question of whether E.O. 1008, as echoed by the R.A. 9285, validly provided for a direct resort to this Court for appeals on the CIAC awards. </p><p> The Court here deems it fit that navigating these constitutional considerations be informed, foremost, by the spirit of the CIAC Charter and the CIAC's primary function and design, with the end in view of clearing road blocks where the Constitution and other laws have placed none. </p><p> The construction industry necessitates the constant and supported availability of speedier and more efficient modes of resolving disputes precisely because of the very nature of the industry itself, where an unsettled dispute can easily run projects to the ground with serious delays and irreparable damage. Major international construction projects typically opt for arbitration as the final tier of dispute resolution for a variety of reasons that serve the parties' interest best, with courts limited to a supportive role.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></p><p> The fundamental advantage of arbitration over litigation in the specialized context of a construction dispute goes into the general flexibility of tailoring the resolution of disputes in a way that serves nuanced business priorities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Arbitration also allows players in this highly competitive and collaborative industry to realize their intentions of resolving conflicts while avoiding courts and preserving professional relationships: </p><blockquote> <p> In each of its niches, construction cases can involve a number of contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers and design professionals. Mediation with a knowledgeable industry professional can not only resolve the dispute, but resolve the dispute with a consensus regarding the cause of the dispute that allows the parties to accept responsibility for their respective obligations. </p> <p> This can lead to a resolution of the conflict which helps maintain relationships and allows companies to work together again.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> With benefits to parties that include the cost and time-efficient process facilitated by neutral and qualified decision makers or the "knowledgeable neutral" which are typically architects, engineers or other industry professionals,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> the availability of arbitration as a mode for resolving construction disputes in the country has served as the impetus for the chartering of the CIAC. Primarily grounded on matters of policy, the CIAC was created precisely to forestall delays that resolution of construction disputes encounters in court litigation, with the recognized net effect of frustrating national development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></p><p> After recapturing the original legislative intent inclined towards promoting arbitration in the area of the CIAC awards, it is next incumbent upon this Court to determine <b><u>with a firm degree of finality and conclusiveness</u></b> whether that precedent design was carried out with procedural and substantive validity, and ultimately whether it cleared all the relevant constitutional hurdles and conditions. </p><p> <i>Appellate Jurisdiction of the Court</i></p><p> The first constitutional limitation that the CIAC's direct appeal to the Court must hurdle is the constitutionally detailed jurisdiction of the Court. Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution outlines the powers of the Judiciary, and Section 5(2) thereof prescribed the Court's appellate jurisdiction, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Section 5.</i> The Supreme Court shall have the following powers: </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (2) Review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on appeal or <i>certiorari</i>, as the law or the Rules of Court may provide, final judgments and orders of lower courts in: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) All cases in which the constitutionality or validity of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation is in question. </p> <p> (b) All cases involving the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, or toll, or any penalty imposed in relation thereto. </p> <p> (c) All cases in which the jurisdiction of any lower court is in issue.</p> <p> (d) All criminal cases in which the penalty imposed is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or higher. </p> <p> (e) All cases in which only an error or question of law is involved. </p> </blockquote> <p> x x x x.</p> </blockquote> <p> Section 5(2), Article VIII has also been considered textually exclusive to courts and does not contemplate quasi-judicial bodies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> In <i>Fabian v. Desierto</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (<i>Fabian</i>), the Solicitor General invoked the application of this provision to support its argument that Section 27<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> of R.A. 6770 does not increase the Court's appellate jurisdiction, as the Court already has jurisdiction over questions of law by virtue of Section 5(2)(e), Article VIII of the Constitution. This argument was, however, rejected by the Court, which interpreted this constitutional grant of appellate jurisdiction to cover only "courts composing the integrated judicial system":<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> We are not impressed by this discourse. It overlooks the fact that by jurisprudential developments over the years, this Court has allowed appeals by [<i>certiorari</i>] under Rule 45 in a substantial number of cases and instances even if questions of fact are directly involved and have to be resolved by the appellate court. Also, the very provision cited by petitioner specifies that the appellate jurisdiction of this Court contemplated therein is to be exercised over "final judgments and orders of <i>lower courts</i>," that is, the courts composing the integrated judicial system. It does not include the quasi-judicial bodies or agencies, hence <b>whenever</b> <b>the legislature intends that the decisions or resolutions of the quasi-judicial agency shall be reviewable by the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, a specific provision to that effect is included in the law creating that quasi-judicial agency and, for that matter, any special statutory court</b>. No such provision on appellate procedure is required for the regular courts of the integrated judicial system because they are what are referred to and already provided for, in Section 5, Article VIII of the Constitution:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Further, this constitutionally determined appellate jurisdiction is prescribed as the minimum breadth of the Court's jurisdiction, as Section 2, Article VIII provides that Congress may not diminish the apportioned appellate jurisdiction of the Court: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Section 2.</i> The Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of various courts but may not deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction over cases enumerated in Section 5 hereof. </p> <p> No law shall be passed reorganizing the Judiciary when it undermines the security of tenure of its Members. </p> </blockquote> <p> In elucidating on the operative interaction of Section 2, Article VIII of the Constitution with Section 5(2), Article VIII, the Court in <i>Morales v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (<i>Morales</i>) held that:</p> <blockquote> <p> Jurisdiction is, of course, conferred by the Constitution or by Congress. <b>Outside the cases enumerated in Section 5(2) of Article VIII of the Constitution, Congress has the plenary power to define, prescribe and apportion the jurisdiction of various courts.</b> Accordingly, Congress may, by law, provide that a certain class of cases should be exclusively heard and determined by one court. Such would be a special law and <u>must be construed as an exception to the general law on jurisdiction of courts, namely, the Judiciary Act of 1948 as amended, or the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980. In short, the special law prevails over the general law</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> This same constitutionally prescribed appellate jurisdiction of the Court is, however, not incapable of increase, for as long as the Court's advice and concurrence under Section 30, Article VI are secured: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Section 30.</i> No law shall be passed increasing the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided in this Constitution without its advice and concurrence.</p> </blockquote> <p> Stated differently, Congress may pass a law that increases the Court's jurisdiction, but not one which decreases it. In case of a law increasing the Court's appellate jurisdiction, such would only violate the constitutional proscription under Section 30, Article VI of the Constitution if it increases the appellate jurisdiction of <i>this Court</i>, not lower courts, without the former's advice and concurrence.</p><p> Proceeding from the doctrine in <i>Morales</i>, it follows that by the legislation of E.O. 1008, as reiterated by R.A. No, 9285, which articulated the law's intent to provide a direct route of appeal from the CIAC to this Court, Congress effectively increased the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to include awards of the CIAC. This increase in appellate jurisdiction, in turn, brings to fore the question of whether the requisite advice and concurrence of the Court under Section 30, Article VI were triggered.</p><p> Thus, the first question distilled for the Court is whether the direct appeal of the CIAC awards to this Court was an effective increase of the Court's appellate jurisdiction which therefore required the Court's blessing through its advice and concurrence. </p><p> The Court finds that there was no such increase in the Court's jurisdiction that required such concurrence. It is decisive to remember that when the 1987 Constitution was created, the Court was already enjoying the jurisdiction over appeal from CIAC awards on pure questions of law, as conferred to it by Congress for two years, by its passage of E.O. 1008. The direct resort to this Court from the CIAC awards on purely legal questions was an increase of the Court's jurisdiction that was already in place prior to the 1987 Constitution's Article VIII, Section 30 which required this Court's advice and concurrence. </p><p> To be sure, when E.O. 1008 was enacted in 1980, no such condition of the Court's advice and concurrence was required anywhere in the 1973 Constitution, and hence at that time, no such concurrence was needed. With the earlier 1935 Constitution, under Section 2, Article VIII thereof, Congress was expressly authorized to define and determine the Court's jurisdiction, without foreclosing the authority to <i>increase the same</i>, the only limitation being against any <i>diminishing</i> of the existing jurisdiction conferred upon it, to wit: </p><p align="center"> <b>ARTICLE VIII</b> </p><p align="center"> <i>Judicial Department</i> </p><p align="center"> x x x x </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 2. <b>The Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe and apportion the jurisdiction of various courts, but may not deprive the Supreme Court of its original jurisdiction over cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, nor of its jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on appeal, <i>certiorari</i>, or writ of error, as the law or the rules of court may provide, final judgments and decrees of inferior courts</b> in &#8212;</p> <blockquote> <p> (1) All cases in which the constitutionality or validity of any treaty, law, ordinance, or executive order or regulation is in question.</p> <p> (2) All cases involving the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, or toll, or any penalty imposed in relation thereto.</p> <p> (3) All cases in which the jurisdiction of any trial court is in issue. </p> <p>(4) All criminal cases in which the penalty imposed is death or life imprisonment.</p> <p> (5) All cases in which an error or question of law is involved.</p> </blockquote> <p> SECTION 3. Until the Congress shall provide otherwise the Supreme Court shall have such original and appellate jurisdiction as may be possessed and exercised by the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands at the time of the adoption of this Constitution. The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court shall include all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Similarly, the 1973 Constitution likewise granted Congress with the authority to define and apportion the Court's jurisdiction, with the sole limitation that its jurisdiction be not diminished.

It stands to undeniable reason therefore that when E.O. 1008 vested this Court with the direct and exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from CIAC awards, the Court's jurisdiction was increased without any need for it to first accede to said increase. </p><p> With all the constitutional conditions met for enabling a direct appeal to the Court, the next question for the Court's determination is the proper remedial route through which the direct appeal of the CIAC awards to this Court may be submitted. </p><p> Based on the prior discussions, appeal from the CIAC awards may no longer be filed under Rule 43. This leaves only appeal by <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 45, which provides: </p><p align="center"> <b>RULE 45</b> </p><p align="center"> <b>Appeal by Certiorari to the Supreme Court</b> </p><blockquote> <p> <b>SECTION 1. </b><i>Filing of Petition with Supreme Court</i>. &#8212; A party desiring to appeal by <em>certiorari</em> from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>. The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth. (1a, 2a) </p> </blockquote> <p> As it stands, Rule 45 contemplates only appeals from final judgments and orders of <i>lower courts</i>, and does not include quasi-judicial bodies or agencies. This differs from the former Rule 45 of the 1964 Rules of Court which made mention only of the CA, and had to be adopted in statutes creating and providing for appeals from certain administrative or quasi-judicial agencies whenever the purpose was to restrict the scope of the appeal to questions of law. </p><p> In furtherance of the animating basis for the direct appeal of the CIAC awards to this Court, CIAC awards may reasonably be considered as an exemption to Rule 45's exclusive contemplation of lower courts. An interpretation otherwise would create a scenario where a procedural limitation, which may be hurdled, <i>i.e</i>., jurisdiction may be increased provided it complies with Section 30, Article VI, operatively prevails over a substantive intendment to the contrary provided by no less than the CIAC's very own charter. Given the unique import of the CIAC's design as a specialized and expedient mode of resolving construction disputes with persuasive finality, its substantive design must be granted primacy over procedural rules that, as will be discussed further, place no insurmountable obstacle before it. </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Appellate Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals as provided by Batas Pambansa Blg. 129</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>With the increase in the Court's appellate jurisdiction found valid, the next constitutional condition that confronts this issue is whether E.O. 1008, issued on February 4, 1985, violated Batas Pambansa Blg.

As applied to the case at bar, B.P. 129 is also an earlier law, 1980 vintage, whereas E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9285 are later laws, E.O. 1008 having been promulgated five years after B.P. 129, and R.A. 9285, which iterated E.O. 1008, being issued in 2004. Therefore, E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9285, as laws that were promulgated subsequent to B.P. 129 and are the later expressions of the legislative will 106 on the matter of CIAC's awards' mode of appeal, must prevail over B.P. 129, thereby carving out CIAC awards as an exception to the CA's appellate jurisdiction over appeals from quasi-judicial agencies. </p><p> Second, with respect to the level of specificity in its application, the statutory canon that also finds bearing in this case is the canon of <i>generalia specialibus non derogant</i>, or a general law does not nullify a specific or special law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> which provides that where two statutes are of equal theoretical application to a particular case, the one designed therefor should prevail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> It is a rule of statutory construction that a special law prevails over a general law &#8212; regardless of their dates of passage &#8212; and the special law is to be considered as an exception to the general law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> In the earlier case of <i>Valera v. Tuason, Jr.</i> ,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> the Court explained the rationale of the hierarchy of laws, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x A special law is not regarded as having been amended or repealed by a general law unless the intent to repeal or alter is manifest. <i>Generalia specialibus non derogant</i>. And this is true although the terms of the general act are broad enough to include the matter in the special statute. ([<i>Manila Railroad Company v. Rafferty</i>] , 40 Phil., 224.) <b>At any rate, in the event harmony between provisions of this type in the same law or in two laws is impossible, the specific provision controls unless the statute, considered in its entirely, indicates a contrary intention upon the part of the legislature.</b> Granting then that the two laws cannot be reconciled, in so far as they are inconsistent with each other, [S]ection 73 of the Code of Civil Procedure, being a specific law, should prevail over, or be considered as an exception to [S]ection 211 of the Administrative Code, which is a provision of general character. A general law is one which embraces a class of subjects or places and does not omit any subject or place naturally belonging to such class, while a special act is one which relates to particular persons or things of a class.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> A more acute case in point, involving a demonstration of a presidential decree carving out an exception in the jurisdictions conferred under B.P. 129, is the case of <i>Tomawis v. Balindong</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Here, the Court settled the issue of jurisdiction over appeals from the Shari'a District Court, and ruled that B.P. 129 was enacted to reorganize only existing civil courts and is a law of general application to the judiciary, whereas P.D. 1083 is a special law that only applies to Shari'a courts, and therefore must prevail in application to Shari 'a courts over the former, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> We have held that a general law and a special law on the same subject are statutes in <i>pari materia</i> and should be <b>read together and harmonized</b>, if possible, with a view to giving effect to both. In the instant case, we apply the principle <i>generalia specialibus non derogant</i>. A<b> general law does not nullify a special law. The general law will yield to the special law in the specific and particular subject embraced in the latter. We must read and construe [B.P.] 129 and [P.D.] 1083 together, then by taking [P.D.] 1083 as an exception to the general law to reconcile the two laws. </b>This is so since the legislature has not made any express repeal or modification of [P.D.] 1083, and it is well-settled that repeals of statutes by implication are not favored. Implied repeals will not be declared unless the intent of the legislators is manifest. Laws are assumed to be passed only after careful deliberation and with knowledge of all existing ones on the subject, and it follows that the legislature did not intend to interfere with or abrogate a former law relating to the same subject matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> A more recent application of this basic principle of statutory construction is in the case of <i>Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) v. Bureau of Internal Revenue</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> x x x The Legislature consider and make provision for all the circumstances of the particular case. <b><i>The Legislature having specially considered all of the facts and circumstances in the particular case in granting a special charter, it will not be considered that the Legislature, by adopting a general law containing provisions repugnant to the provisions of the charter, and without making any mention of its intention to amend or modify the charter, intended to amend, repeal, or modify the special act.</i></b> (<i>Lewis [v.] Cook County</i>, 74 Ill. App., 151; <i>Philippine Railway Co. [v.] Nolting</i>, 34 Phil., 401).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Bringing the case at bar through this second frame of statutory construction, the Court finds that with respect to the level of generality or specialty, B.P. 129 is a general law of procedure and jurisdiction, and must therefore yield to the more specific laws of E.O. 1008 and its iteration in R.A. 9285, which distinctively pertain to the CIAC and other alternative modes of arbitration. </p><p> In other words, this reconciliation of laws and rules stands on the uncontroverted premise that when E.O. 1008 conferred on this Court the jurisdiction over appeals from CIAC awards, said conferment survived the subsequent <b><u>procedural</u></b> digressions, so that R.A. 9285 and the Special ADR Rules needed no Court concurrence, for they could no more restore to this Court a jurisdiction that it never validly lost. <b>Stated differently, when R.A. 9285 reiterated the direct recourse of appeals from CIAC awards to this Court, it did not endow the Court with any new jurisdiction that it did not already have as validly apportioned to it as early as 1980. </b>There is therefore no need for the Court's concurrence as required under the 1987 Constitution, as there was, in fact, no <i>increase</i> to concur with. </p><p> Pursuant to these two canons of reconciling apparent conflicts in application of laws, it inevitably appears that with respect to the conferment of jurisdiction to the CA of appellate jurisdiction over CIAC awards, both E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9285 have sufficiently carved CIAC awards as an exception therefrom. </p><p> <i>Exclusive Rule-Making Power of the Court</i></p><p> The third and final circumscription that CIAC's awards' mode of appeal to the Court must consider is the relation of the power of Congress under Section 2, Article VIII <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution, with regard to the rule-making power of the Court. Section 5(5), Article VIII provides: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Section 5</i>.

In <i>Echegaray v.

To reiterate, the Court's authority to promulgate rules on pleading, practice, and procedure is exclusive and one of the safeguards of Our institutional independence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Balanced against the authority of Congress to grant or define the jurisdiction of courts, the rule-making power of the Court is proscribed against promulgating rules that diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. </p><p> In <i>Fabian</i>, the question was raised as to whether the Court, in holding that the CA is the proper court to review the final judgements of quasi-judicial agencies even in light of a law vesting the Court with the power to do so, would be disregarding a substantive right. The Court ruled in the negative, explaining in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x This brings to fore the question of whether Section 27 of [R.A.] 6770 is substantive or procedural. </p> <p> It will be noted that no definitive line can be drawn between those rules or statutes which are procedural, hence within the scope of this Court's rule-making power, and those which are substantive. <b>In fact, a particular rule may be procedural in one context and substantive in another.</b> It is admitted that what is procedural and what is substantive is frequently a question of great difficulty. It is not, however, an insurmountable problem if a rational and pragmatic approach is taken within the context of our own procedural and jurisdictional system. </p> <p> In determining whether a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court, for the practice and procedure of the lower courts, abridges, enlarges, or modifies any substantive right, the test is <b>whether the rule really regulates procedure, that is, the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for a disregard or infraction of them. If the rule takes away a vested right, it is not procedural. If the rule creates a right such as the right to appeal, it may be classified as a substantive matter; but if it operates as a means of implementing an existing right then the rule deals merely with procedure.</b> </p> <p> In the situation under consideration, a transfer by the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its rule-making power, of pending cases involving a review of decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary actions to the Court of Appeals which shall now be vested with exclusive appellate jurisdiction thereover, relates to procedure only. <u>This is so because it is not the right to appeal of an aggrieved party which is affected by the law. That <i>right</i> has been preserved. Only the <i>procedure</i> by which the appeal is to be made or decided has been changed. The rationale for this is that no litigant has a vested right in a particular remedy, which may be changed by substitution without impairing vested rights, hence he can have none in rules of procedure which relate to the remedy.</u> </p> <p> Furthermore, it cannot be said that the transfer of appellate jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals in this case is an act of creating a new right of appeal because such power of the Supreme Court to transfer appeals to subordinate appellate courts is purely a procedural and not a substantive power. Neither can we consider such transfer as impairing a vested right because the parties have still a remedy and still a competent tribunal to administer that remedy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Fabian</i>, the Court went on to elucidate that the transfer by this Court, in the exercise of its rule-making power, of pending cases involving a review of decisions of the Ombudsman (OMB) in administrative disciplinary actions to the CA which shall now be vested with exclusive appellate jurisdiction over these, relates to <i>procedure only</i>. This is so because it is not the right to appeal of an aggrieved party which is affected by the law, as that <i>right</i> has been preserved, with only the <i>procedure</i> by which the appeal is to be made or decided changed. </p><p> A sharp distinction on the matter of the effect of the rule pulls the case of CIAC awards far from that of <i>Fabian</i>, as in the latter, the Court's act of transferring appellate jurisdiction over the OMB decisions to the CA did not undermine or significantly alter the party's right to appeal. </p><p> In clear contrast, the Court's act of including CIAC awards among those situations the appeal from which must be brought before the CA <i>via</i> Rule 43, instead of on a direct recourse to it as specified under E.O. 1008, did not provide a <i>mere</i> procedure of appeal of CIAC awards, <b><u>but correspondingly diminished the substantive rights of parties who, pre-conflict, had elected arbitration as their speedier recourse in case of dispute</u></b>. </p><p> The compelling weight of the preservation of the speed, autonomy and finality of CIAC awards is best validated by the kind of tailor-made fit with which the design of arbitration serves the unique demands of the construction industry. <b><u>Parties in construction disputes have also been known to predictably choose arbitration over litigation due to the limitation of the right to appeal thereto, particularly in that laws of many jurisdictions permit appeals of arbitral awards only on limited grounds</u></b>. </p><p> Demonstrably, construction is a specialized industry with projects that are prone to disputes owing to multiple parties, performance standards, as well as financing and profit considerations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> The construction businesses' resort to alternative modes of resolution that seek to settle controversies as opposed to pursuit of lawsuits was even called a paradigm shift, which resulted from the wave of increasing need for dispute resolutions, and the inversely proportional decrease of incentives for litigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Parties in construction disputes were afforded, by legislation, with the alternative route to an expedited and authoritative resolution of their disputes. The availability of this conclusive alternative mode, which had been hailed as the preferred method of resolving high-value disputes, is vital to the growth of the construction industry, and diluting the same undoubtedly amounts to the diminishing of the parties' substantive right. </p><p> <b><u>Once more, the substantive right is contained in the parties' preference to avail of speed, flexibility, cost efficiency and industry knowledge to obtain the most autonomous arbitration result possible.</u></b></p><p> Autonomous arbitration is one which is initiated, conducted and concluded without any need or desire for judicial intervention,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> with the United States Supreme Court even affirming early on that the unmistakable purpose of Congress in affording parties with the arbitration procedure was so that the resolution of the dispute between parties who opt for arbitration be "speedy and not subject to delay and obstruction of the courts".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> The paradigm of autonomy likewise gives the parties the confidence to invite specialists to resolve complex issues which are beyond the proficiency of court judges.</p><p> <b><u>This substantive right to access this arbitration autonomy</u></b> is unambiguously subverted by the Court's overreaching exercise of its rule-making power, in its act of delegating to the CA what the legislative wisdom otherwise categorically conferred directly and exclusively upon this Court. The defeat of this right is evident in the frustration of the reasons that prompted the parties to choose arbitration over litigation in the first place. More particularly, the inclusion of the CIAC under Rule 43 weakened if not altogether destroyed the authoritative autonomy of the CIAC, as well as eroded if not totally obliterated its very nature as the expedited, economical, independent alternative dispute resolution to the otherwise protracted and costly court litigation. </p><p> To be sure, the inclusion of the CIAC under Rule 43 is a clear <b><u>impairment</u></b> of the central substantive right which animates the overall design of the CIAC, and is therefore invalid for overstepping the positive limitation of the rule-making power of this Court under Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution on non-modification of substantive rights. Thus, nothing prevents this Court from correcting this over-inclusion, as it now does in the case at bar. </p><p> In all, the nexus between the judiciary and the arbitral tribunal is nothing short of paradoxical, in that on the one hand, the courts often ensure the integrity of the arbitration, but on the other, the apprehensions regarding court involvement have precisely led parties to opt for arbitration, in the first instance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> As the case at bar exhibits, perhaps the point has always been not complete severance between the two, but only a guarantee that judicial involvement is limited to a minimum to promote the rationale of arbitration, so that it is not so much judicial control, as it is judicial encouragement through restraint.</p><p> All told and reconciled, the Court sitting <i>en banc</i> takes this overdue opportunity to straighten out the route that an appeal from a CIAC arbitral award may take, and inevitably carve its remedial recourse out of procedural tiers that are wholly inconsistent with the very <i>animus</i> of this arbitral tribunal.</p><p> A harmonization of these conflicting rules leaves the Court with the conclusion that the inclusion of the CIAC under Rule 43 appeals is without footing in the legal history of the CIAC, and therefore must be unequivocally reversed.</p><p> More specifically, the Court holds that the direct recourse of an appeal of a CIAC award on questions of law directly to this Court is the rule, pursuant to E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9285, notwithstanding Rule 43 on the CA's jurisdiction over quasi-judicial agencies, and Rule 45 in its exclusive application to lower courts. Thus, an appeal from an arbitral award of the CIAC may take either of two tracks, as determined by the subject matter of the challenge.</p><p> On the one hand, if the parties seek to challenge a finding of law of the tribunal, then the same may be appealed only to this Court under Rule 45. To determine whether a question is one of law which <i>may</i> be brought before the Court under Rule 45, it is useful to recall that a question of law involves a doubt or controversy as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, as opposed to a question of fact which involves a doubt or difference that arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts, or when the query necessarily calls for a review and reevaluation of the whole evidence, including the credibility of witnesses, existence of specific surrounding circumstances, and the decided probabilities of the situation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> The test here is not the party's characterization of the question before the Court, but whether the Court may resolve the issue brought to it by solely inquiring as to whether the law was properly applied and without going into a review of the evidence.</p><p> On the other hand, if the parties seek to challenge the CIAC's finding of fact, the same may only be allowed under either of two premises, namely assailing the very integrity of the composition of the tribunal, or alleging the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law, in which cases the appeal may be filed before the CA on these limited grounds through the special civil action of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65, in accordance with Section 4 in relation to Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>SECTION 1. </b><i>Petition for certiorari</i>. &#8212; When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require. </p> <p> The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the judgment, order or resolution subject thereof, copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto, and a sworn certification of non-forum shopping as provided in the third paragraph of section 3, Rule 46.

It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.

(<i>As amended by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, December 12, 2007</i>.) </p> </blockquote> <p> As observed by Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo (Chief Justice Gesmundo) during the deliberations, it would be entirely unsupported for appeal under Rule 43 to remain available for CIAC awards after a clear demonstration to the contrary. </p><p> Furthermore, Justice Leonen, in his <em>Concurring Opinion</em>, sharply summarizes the utter lack of basis in this erroneous inclusion of the CIAC under Rule 43 appeals, which he calls out to be an "unfortunate mistake": </p><blockquote> <p> Since the Construction Industry Arbitration Law's adoption in 1985, procedural law and related jurisprudence have made it appear that appeals may also be taken to the Court of Appeals. There, the factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may supposedly be assailed. This has been an unfortunate mistake. <b>The Court of Appeal's supposed appellate jurisdiction to freely review factual issues finds no basis in substantive law.</b> </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> It is opportune to repudiate the mistaken notion that appeals on questions of fact of CIAC awards may be coursed through the Court of Appeals. No statute actually vests jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals to entertain petitions for review emanating from the CIAC. <i>Metro Construction</i>'s reference to a "procedural mutation" effected by Circular No. 1-91, 1095 and Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure do not broaden the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Neither do the amendments introduced to Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 by Republic Act No. 7902 effect a broadening of the Court of Appeals' appellate jurisdiction thereby extending it to a factual review of CIAC arbitral awards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The resort to Rule 65, instead of Rule 43, further finds support in the very nature of the factual circumstances which trigger said exceptional factual review&#8212;those that center not on the actual findings of fact but on the integrity of the tribunal that makes these findings, or their compliance with the Constitution or positive law, <i>i.e</i>., any of the following factual allegations: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under Section 9 of R.A. 876, and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup></p><p> These are the scenarios that Chief Justice Gesmundo, keenly referred to as "tribunal-centered" and not "fact-centered" which must necessarily reframe whether the CA may or may not review the decisions of the CIAC, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> If a legal remedy exists for the review of factual findings of the arbitral tribunal in the context of assailing the integrity of its composition, the question that should be asked is, should the subject matter of the appeal pertain to the alleged errors in the factual findings of the arbitral tribunal, or should the appeal center on the lack of integrity of the composition of the arbitral tribunal? Definitely, if there is no question on the integrity of the composition of the arbital tribunal, its award may not be subject to appeal on factual considerations. Consequently, the remedy contemplated is tribunal-centered and not fact-centered. This issue is important because it will determine whether the CA has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal in the first place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Proceeding from this framing of factual issues which fall within the narrow window of the Court's factual review of CIAC awards, the Court holds that these challenges to the CIAC tribunal's integrity or allegations of constitutional or statutory violations on the part of the arbitral tribunal, as further enumerated under Section 24<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> of R.A. 876, partake of the nature of imputations of grave abuse which more accurately belong within the purview of a special civil action of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65. Stated differently, the Court recognizes, as earlier distilled in jurisprudence, that although the challenges to the integrity of the CIAC arbitral tribunal are first enumerated in Section 24 of R.A. 876, the same grounds are also descriptive of the narrow set of situations that may warrant the Court's review of the same, as an exception to the more general rule that factual findings of the CIAC arbitral tribunal are beyond review. Once more, as correctly noted by Chief Justice Gesmundo, this appears to be the Court's understanding in its discussion of the said grounds in the case of <i>Hi&shy; Precision Steel Center, Inc. v. Lim Kim Steel Builders, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (<i>Hi-Precision</i>), when it reiterated that it will not relitigate issues of fact previously resolved by an arbitral tribunal, save for the instance of a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion, citing as examples thereof those very instances referred to under Section 24 of R.A. 876, <i>viz.</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private purposes. The Court will not review the factual findings of an arbitral tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had "misapprehended the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as "legal questions." The parties here had recourse to arbitration and chose the arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in such arbitrators. The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued before the Arbitral Tribunal, save only where <b>a very clear showing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of jurisdiction</b>. Prototypical examples would be factual conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the other party of a fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through fraud or the corruption of arbitrators. Any other, more relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration and would reduce arbitration to a largely inutile institution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Collectively, these factual scenarios, when alleged, essentially challenge the integrity of the arbitral tribunal or the constitutionality or legality of the conduct of the arbitral process, and therefore warrant an entertainment of doubt with respect to the factual findings of said tribunal. These factual allegations, which replicate the grounds for vacating an arbitral award as provided in Section 24 of R.A. 876, have been found by the Court to be the same factual allegations that will trigger an exceptional factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, as this Court has laid down in S<i>pouses David v. Construction Industry and Arbitration Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> <i>CE Construction Corp. v.

Rante</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> The Court, in these cases, saw it fit to exemplify the breadth of what may constitute grave abuse of discretion with the enumeration of scenarios carried over from Section 24 of R.A. 876, in order to fine-tune the operative examples of grave abuse in the context of the CIAC arbitral tribunals. This is further consistent with the caution of the Court in <i>Hi&shy;-Precision</i> when it warned that "x x x [a]ny other, more relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration x x x." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> The Court's consistent pronouncement in the above cases only reinforce its attitude towards CIAC arbitral awards, <i>i.e</i>., that factual findings of the CIAC arbitral tribunal are final unless the integrity of said tribunal or the constitutionality or legality of its actions are put in question. </p><p> Told differently, the limited instances which parties may cite as impetus for a judicial factual review of a CIAC award pertain to integrity-centered or Constitution or law-anchored flaws which, in turn, translate to grave abuses of discretion that are within the ambit of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65. The correspondence is made clear given the very nature of a Rule 65 petition, and the metes and bounds of the issues it is designed to resolve. Demonstrably, in the case of <i>Tagle v. Equitable PCI Bank</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> the Court spoke plainly: </p><blockquote> <p> A special civil action for <i>Certiorari</i>, or simply a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court is intended for the correction of errors of jurisdiction only or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Its principal office is only to keep the inferior court within the parameters of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. </p> <p> A writ of <i>certiorari</i> may be issued only for the correction of errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Such cannot be used for any other purpose, as its function is limited to keeping the inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction. </p> <p> For a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to prosper, the essential requisites that have to concur are: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. </p> <p> The phrase "<i>without jurisdiction</i>" means that the court acted with absolute lack of authority or want of legal power, right or authority to hear and determine a cause or causes, considered either in general or with reference to a particular matter. It means lack of power to exercise authority. "<i>Excess of jurisdiction</i>" occurs when the court transcends its power or acts without any statutory authority; or results when an act, though within the general power of a tribunal, board or officer (to do) is not authorized, and invalid with respect to the particular proceeding, because the conditions which alone authorize the exercise of the general power in respect of it are wanting. While that of "<i>grave abuse of discretion</i>" implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as to be equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction; simply put, power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility; and such exercise is so patent or so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal either to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Further, the resort to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is confined to assailing the integrity of the arbitral tribunal based on any of the aforementioned factual scenarios (<i>e.g</i>., corruption, fraud, evident partiality of the tribunal), or the constitutionality or legality of the conduct of the arbitration process, and may not remain unqualified as to embrace other badges of grave abuse. The design and intent of the relevant laws on judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards do not empower the CA to look into the factual findings of the CIAC apart from the foregoing circumscribed grounds, lest the authoritative and conclusive factual findings of the CIAC be nevertheless defeated, albeit <i>via</i> a petition other than Rule 43. </p><p> This operative limiting of the grounds under Rule 65 with respect to judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards remains consistent with the Court's constitutionally granted authority, owing chiefly to the conceptually dynamic nature of grave abuse of discretion. To be sure, the Constitution provided the Court's power to take cognizance of petitions alleging grave abuse of discretion, with the second paragraph of Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution particularly stating: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Section 1.</i> The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.</p> <p> <b>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. </b>(Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> However, far from being static, the very contours of what constitutes grave abuse of discretion have always been traced by the Court in a judicious but fragmentary manner, as called for by each case in jurisprudence. Distinctively, therefore, although the remedy of petition for <i>certiorari</i>, as the procedural vehicle, is purposefully rigid and unyielding in order to avoid overextension of the same over situations that do not raise an error of jurisdiction, the concept of grave abuse of discretion which must be alleged to avail of the <i>certiorari</i> remedy is, in the same degree, deliberately flexible, in order to enable it to capture a whole spectrum of permutations of grave abuse. If the case were otherwise, <i>i.e</i>., if the concept of grave abuse were rigid, and the <i>certiorari</i> remedy loose, the same would be exposed to the possibility of having a clear act of whim and caprice placed beyond the ambit of the court's <i>certiorari</i> power because of a definitional discomfiture in the legal procedure. </p><p> On point is the case of <i>Oposa v. Factoran, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> where the Court, citing Justice Isagani A. Cruz, described the dynamic property of the concept of grave abuse in the context of the expanded judicial review power, and succinctly described it thus: </p><blockquote> <p> As worded, the new provision vests in the judiciary, and particularly the Supreme Court, the power to rule upon even the wisdom of the decisions of the executive and the legislature and to declare their acts invalid for lack or excess of jurisdiction because tainted with grave abuse of discretion. <b>The catch, of course, is the meaning of 'grave abuse of discretion,' which is a <u>very elastic phrase</u> that can expand or contract <u>according to the disposition of the judiciary</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The elasticity of the Court's use of its power of judicial review under the 'grave abuse of discretion' standard has also been suggested as that which significantly depends on a variety of considerations, even including the "rationality, predispositions, and value judgments"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> of the Court's members. This conceptual malleability of 'grave abuse of discretion' allows it to stretch as it needs to cover vast permutations of grave abuse, but also contracts, as the Court here deems it fit, so as not to negate categorical legislative intent as provided for by E.O. 1008.</p><p> In point of fact, grave abuse as a ground for judicial review covers a multitude of scenarios, with each operative definition colored with caprice or whim, but fleshed out in a variety of commissions, and embraces not only those which betray a possible challenge on the integrity of an arbitral tribunal. </p><p> Early jurisprudence has laid down a broad construction of what constitutes grave abuse of discretion. In the 1939 case of <i>Santos v. Province of Tarlac</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> the concept of abuse of discretion was construed as that which contemplates such a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. This was later echoed in the 1941 case of <i>Alafriz v. Nable</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> where the Court defined grave abuse as that where the court has acted "x x x with absolute want of jurisdiction x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> or where the court has transcended its jurisdiction or "x x x acted without any statutory authority x x x".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> </p><p> In the 1960 case of <i>Hamoy v. Hon. Sec. of Agriculture and Natural Resources, et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> the Court added that the abuse of discretion must be shown to be attended by "x x x passion, prejudice, or personal hostility amounting to an evasion of positive duty x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> Still, in 1966, in the case of <i>Palma and Ignacio v. Q. &amp; S. Inc., et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> the Court further qualified abuse of discretion and added that an error of judgment is not abuse of discretion, as the same must be colored with despotism or whim, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [A]n abuse of discretion is not sufficient by itself to justify the issuance of a writ of [<i>certiorari</i>]. x x x [T]he abuse must be grave and patent, and it must be shown that the discretion was exercised arbitrarily or despotically x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In 1979, in <i>Dimayacyac v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> the trial court therein was found to have committed grave abuse of discretion for declaring a party before in default and rendering judgment against them hurriedly, for mere failure of the party in default to file a pre-trial brief. In the case of <i>Producers Bank of the Phils. v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> grave abuse of discretion was construed as such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment that is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction and involves power that is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility. Grave abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all m contemplation of law. </p><p> To note, in the 1999 case of <i>Nepomuceno v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> the Court ruled that "grave abuse of discretion is indeed a relative term"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> and admits of exceptions in the interest of substantial justice. </p><p> Recent jurisprudential iterations have further maintained this construction of grave abuse of discretion. In the case of <i>Due&ntilde;as, Jr. v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> grave abuse of discretion was defined as the capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment, or the exercise of power in an arbitrary manner, where the abuse is so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> In <i>Cruz v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> manifest disregard of basic rules and procedures constituted grave abuse of discretion. In <i>Comilang v. Belen</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> a showing of manifest bias and partiality likewise amounted to grave abuse. <i>Neri v. Yu</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> also defined grave abuse as that which includes not only palpable errors of jurisdiction or violations of the Constitution, the law, and jurisprudence, but also includes gross misapprehension of facts. </p><p> Indicatively, going by the jurisprudential construction of grave abuse of discretion as contemplated by Rule 65, the same decidedly casts a wider net than that which is consistent with the narrower confines of factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, and covers numerous other scenarios apart from that which may amount to a challenge of the integrity of a tribunal. The above cases demonstrate badges of grave abuse that could not have been contemplated as far as factual review of CIAC awards is concerned. To leave this Rule 65 resort unqualified is, therefore, to leave it overinclusive, at the expense of the weight and conclusiveness of findings of fact of the CIAC. Stated differently, precisely because challenging the integrity, constitutionality or legality of the tribunal or its actions in the arbitral process are only some of the many permutations of grave abuse within the construction of Rule 65, the delimitation is crucial for purposes of factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, if a resort to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is to be made consistent with E.O. 1008. </p><p> By extension, if the petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 route for review of CIAC arbitral awards remains as indiscriminate as the scope of Rule 65 as it is more generally applied, it would entertain grounds for factual review that E.O. 1008 and other relevant rules intended to keep out. </p><p> The Court herein emphasizes that the qualification and contraction of the concept of grave abuse of discretion under Rule 65 with respect to a CIAC arbitral award calibrates, instead of confuses, the grounds for a Rule 65 petition. It is a contraction that is imperative if remedial law is to promote, and not frustrate, the unique configuration of the CIAC, and enable it to unfold as designed within the structure of the present remedial rules. It does not proceed from the presumption that said contraction is being made in order to address what may experientially be seen as a loose treatment of the <i>certiorari </i>action in practice. On the contrary, the contraction is being made not because the <i>certiorari</i> power is being indiscriminately employed, but because in itself, even with its rigid application, said <i>certiorari</i> power is still not narrow enough given the framework that the persuasive authority of CIAC awards must be ascribed primacy. </p><p> The Court also holds with particular import that there is nothing procedurally problematic or constitutionally abhorrent in distilling the prototypical grounds under Section 24 of R.A. 876 as reflective of the very grounds which show a grave abuse of discretion in relation to CIAC arbitral awards. There is nothing precarious in the Court's acknowledgment that the concept of grave abuse is elastic enough to lend itself to the Court's calibration depending on the context within which it is to be appreciated. </p><p> Contrary to the caution offered that the concept of grave abuse of discretion is tantamount to judicial legislation, the Court here discerns that its appropriation of the prototypical grounds as provided under Section 24 of R.A. 876 into the judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards, as well as its appreciation of the nuanced expressions of grave abuse of discretion in this specific context squarely fall within the rule-making power of the Court. The authority is rooted in Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution, and the impetus therefor described as thus: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x This deliberate expansion of both judicial review and rule-making powers of the Philippine Supreme Court typifies the active re-direction of the Court's role, away from the passivity under the standard political question doctrine that had predominated earlier constitutional eras under the 1973 and 1935 Constitutions. </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> When the 1986 EDSA "People Power" Revolution successfully ousted Marcos, one of the first acts of the new government under Corazon Aquino (and facilitated by now Constitutional Commissioner Roberto Concepcion) was to strengthen the independence and judicial review powers of the Philippine Supreme Court. Under the 1987 Constitution, the Philippine Supreme Court was intentionally entrusted with broader judicial review and rule-making powers. The framers of the 1987 Constitution envisioned that the Court as the institution most critical to safeguarding democracy in the Philippines' post-dictatorship constitutional order. Wary of the Court's reputational decline in <i>Javellana</i>, the Philippine Supreme Court under the 1987 Constitutional reiterated fidelity to the Constitution as the foremost mandate of judicial conduct: "Justices and judges must ever realize that they have no constituency, serve no majority nor minority but serve only the public interest as they see it in accordance with their oath of office, guided only by the Constitution and their own conscience and honour."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Markedly, as the Court has held in <i>Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> and <i>Estipona, Jr. v. Lobrigo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> the independent rule-making power of the Court is a reaction to the prevenient disposition of the Court that consigns it to sidestep matters of inequity or injustice in the court proceedings because of its lack of power to procedurally address them. The Court therefore holds that this is not a dangerous precedent but a mere exercise of extant rule-making and <i>certiorari</i> powers of the Court. This authority also since pivoted the Court away from the previous institutional attitude of avoidance. </p><p> More, the exercise of contracting grave abuse of discretion in order to correct what has been shown to be a procedural confoundment in the instant case is not new either in the Court's jurisprudential history or its immediate horizon. Perhaps, there will be future inadequacies in procedure that the Court will be moved to remedy, and that the same will require its reconciliation or harmonization with substantive laws. The reinforced rule-making power of the Court straightforwardly allows it to undertake the same, as it now does. </p><p> As is apparent in the two grounds that trigger the exceptional factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, <i>i.e.</i>, those that pertain to either the lack of integrity or the imputed unconstitutionality or illegality of the arbitrators or the arbitral process, the contracted grounds are tight enough, but nevertheless embrace and preserve the courts' power to re-examine factual findings of a CIAC arbitral tribunal, precisely when the latter's lack of integrity, or its unconstitutional or illegal actions taint the same. Most assuredly, the power of the courts to uphold the Constitution and preserve observance of positive law are woven into the very fabric of the judicial system, and remain undiminished in the Court's present interpretation of the available remedial routes from CIAC arbitral awards. </p><p> Therefore, in the instant case and for purposes of judicial review of the CIAC arbitral awards, this Court now divines Rule 65, being confined to challenges only to the arbitral tribunal's integrity or allegations of its actions' unconstitutionality or illegality, to be a warranted contraction of the breadth of the concept of 'grave abuse of discretion', in order to harmonize a Rule 65 resort with the unequivocal intent of E.O. 1008, and other relevant laws, including R.A. 876 and R.A. 9285, which apply supplementarily. To be sure, although E.O. 1008 applies specifically to the CIAC as a specialized arbitral institution for the construction industry, nothing precludes the Court from applying the umbrella legislation of R.A. 876 and its significant amendment, R.A. 9285. </p><p> Undoubtedly, R.A. 876, R.A. 9285 and E.O. 1008, while distinct, are conceptually and operatively related in the sphere of arbitration law. For one, R.A. 9285 expressly references E.O. 1008 as the rules of procedure that apply to construction disputes. The whole of its Chapter 6 pertains to arbitration of construction disputes where, substantively: (1) Section 17(d)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> thereof provides its application to mediated construction disputes, (2) Sections 28<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> and 29 <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> thereof outline the availability of interim measures of protection in construction arbitration, (3) Section 35<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> thereof enumerates the kinds of disputes that fall within the purview of the CIAC's jurisdiction, and (4) Section 39<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> thereof relatedly authorizes the regional trial courts to dismiss a construction dispute before it, if the same involves an arbitration clause that was not previously resorted to. </p><p> As well, the Special ADR Rules further categorically refer to R.A. 876 when it laid down the grounds for which, as a general rule, the court may vacate or set aside the decision of an arbitral tribunal. Specifically, Rule 19.10 of the same provides: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>RULE 19.10. <i>Rule on judicial review on arbitration in the Philippines.</i> - As a general rule, the court can only vacate or set aside the decision of an arbitral tribunal upon a clear showing that the award suffers from any of the infirmities or grounds for vacating an arbitral award under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876 or under Rule 34 of the Model Law</b> in a domestic arbitration, or for setting aside an award in an international arbitration under Article 34 of the Model Law, or for such other grounds provided under these Special Rules.</p> <p> If the Regional Trial Court is asked to set aside an arbitral award in a domestic or international arbitration on any ground other than those provided in the Special ADR Rules, the court shall entertain such ground for the setting aside or non-recognition of the arbitral award only if the same amounts to a violation of public policy. </p> <p> The court shall not set aside or vacate the award of the arbitral tribunal merely on the ground that the arbitral tribunal committed errors of fact, or of law, or of fact and law, as the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the arbitral tribunal. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Still, illustratively, in the case of <i>LM Power Engineering Corporation v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166] </sup>the Court found no impediment in applying R.A. 876 in a suppletory nature to an otherwise purely CIAC-governed dispute, in order to stay the court proceedings where the dispute was found to be arbitrable before the CIAC: </p><blockquote> <p> The arbitral clause in the Agreement is a commitment on the part of the parties to submit to arbitration the disputes covered therein. Because that clause is binding, they are expected to abide by it in good faith. And because it covers the dispute between the parties in the present case, either of them may compel the other to arbitrate. </p> <p> Since petitioner has already filed a Complaint with the RTC without prior recourse to arbitration, the proper procedure to enable the CIAC to decide on the dispute is to request the stay or suspension of such action, as provided under [R.A.] 876 [the Arbitration Law].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> To note, although Section 24 of R.A. 876 has not been transplanted verbatim into the CIAC Rules, the logic behind its adaption into the judicial review of the arbitral awards remains unrefuted. It likewise remains to be negated the fact that the Court has already jurisprudentially appropriated Section 24 of R.A. 876 as the very same situations that may justify the Court's examination of CIAC arbitral award's findings of fact. </p><p> Furthermore, and assuredly, the resort to the courts was legislatively designed to succeed other remedies that disputants before the CIAC may avail themselves of in case of errors in an arbitral tribunal's award that merit its modification. The current CIAC Rules provide a remedy that allows the parties to winnow through their arbitral award and effect the correction of gross errors such as mathematical miscalculations and the like. The more general R.A. 876, particularly, Section 25 thereof provides: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Section 25. </b>Grounds for modifying or correcting award. - In any one of the following cases, the court must make an order modifying or correcting the award, upon the application of any party to the controversy which was arbitrated: </p> <blockquote> <p> (a) Where there was an <b>evident miscalculation of figures, or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred</b> to in the award; or</p> <p> (b) Where the arbitrators have <b>awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, <i><u>not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted</u></i></b>; or</p> <p> (c) Where the <b>award is imperfect in a matter of form <i><u>not affecting the merits of the controversy</u></i></b>, and if it had been a commissioner's report, the defect could have been amended or disregarded by the court. </p> </blockquote> <p> The order may modify and correct the award so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> This enumeration of grounds for correction of errors in arbitral awards was adopted and echoed in the CIAC Rules,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> specifically Section 17 thereof: </p><blockquote> <p> <b><i>SECTION 17.1 Motion for correction of final award</i></b> - Any of the parties may file a motion for correction of the Final award within fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof upon any of the following grounds: </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">a.</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">an evident miscalculation of figures, a typographical or arithmetical error;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">b.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">an evident mistake in the description of any party, person, date, amount, thing or property referred to in the award.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">c.</div></td> <td><div align="justify">where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, <b><u>not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted</u></b>;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">d.</div></td> <td><div align="justify">where the arbitrators have failed or omitted to resolve certain issue/s formulated by the parties in the Terms of Reference (TOR) and submitted to them for resolution; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">e.</div></td> <td><div align="justify">where the award is <b><u>imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy</u></b>.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The motion shall be acted upon by the Arbitral Tribunal or the surviving/remaining members. </p> <blockquote> <p> <b>17.1.1</b> The filing of the motion for correction shall interrupt the running of the period for appeal. </p> <p> <b>17.1.2</b> A motion for correction upon grounds other than those mentioned in this section shall not interrupt the running of the period for appeal. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Crucially, however, the above grounds that merit a modification or correction of an arbitral award, whether in the earlier provisions under R.A. 876 or in the recent iterations under the CIAC Rules, importantly: (1) do not pertain to any allegation of fraud, corruption, or grave abuse; and (2) pertain only to honest mistakes, miscalculations of figures, and do not affect the arbitral tribunal's findings with respect to the very merit of the dispute. </p><p> Evidently therefore, the intent of the relevant laws with respect to the treatment of arbitral awards is two-tiered: first, that they are final as far as their appreciation of the facts that go into the merit of the dispute is concerned; and second, in case of obvious errors of facts (<em>e.g.,</em> miscalculations), they are modifiable or correctible only insofar as they do not affect the merits of the controversy. Such is the restrained attitude that courts were intended to maintain with respect to arbitral awards. Such purposively narrow windows for changing the arbitral tribunal's award are most in consonance with the confined posture towards appeals as unambiguously provided for by E.O. 1008, and as fleshed out by R.A. 9285 and the Special ADR Rules. </p><p> For more than preserving expediency and convenience, this restrained attitude against challenging arbitral awards on their merits most importantly respects party-autonomy, which is the essence of arbitration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> and the pro-arbitration State policy of the country. So that when the courts deem a CIAC arbitral award as final, barring exceptions, the courts are really upholding the substantive rights of the disputing parties and their exercise of autonomy in deciding in what manner, for how long, and before which forum their dispute is to be resolved. This is but the Court's recognition that party-autonomy underpins the very option of disputing parties to refer their construction dispute before the CIAC, and that the same has been central in the legislative intendment of a more limited and restricted mode of judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards. </p><p> For the avoidance of doubt, the Court now holds that the judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards takes either of two remedial routes, depending on the issue being raised. <i>First</i>, if the issue raised is a pure question of law, the petition should be filed directly and exclusively with the Court, notwithstanding Rule 43. <i>Second</i>, in cases where the petition takes issue on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal and its decision, (<i>i.e</i>., allegations of corruption, fraud, misconduct, evident partiality, incapacity or excess of powers within the tribunal), or the unconstitutionality or invalidity of its actions in the arbitral process<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> then the parties can and should appeal the CIAC award before the CA under Rule 65, on grounds of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess in jurisdiction, where a factual review may then be had by the CA. </p><p> Concomitantly, the availability of a resort to the CA <i>via</i> a Rule 65 petition under these circumstances must also necessarily amend Rule 19.7 of the Special ADR Rules which proscribes any filing of a special civil action of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>. This necessary amendment will allow for the narrowest of grounds for a factual review of a CIAC arbitral award to be brought before the proper court through the correct action. This amendment is also merited so that the Special ADR Rules may not, without their intention, frustrate instead of facilitate the modes of appeal from CIAC arbitral awards. </p><p> This harmonization is most consistent with the spirit of the law which created the CIAC, as was reaffirmed by R.A. 9285 and the Special ADR Rules. Accordingly, all rules and regulations that allow the contrary, including the pertinent provisions in the Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, Rule 43 of the Rules and the CIAC Rules, should be deemed amended to conform to the rule on direct resort to this Court on pure questions of law.

This is expressed in the familiar legal maxim <i>lex prospicit, non respicit</i>, the law looks forward not backward. The rationale against retroactivity is easy to perceive. The retroactive application of a law usually divests rights that have already become vested or impairs the obligations of contract and hence, is unconstitutional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The Court hereby sets the following guidelines with respect to the application of the present ruling on modes of judicial review<em> vis-&agrave;-vis </em>CIAC arbitral awards: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">1.</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">For appeals from CIAC arbitral awards that have already been filed and are currently pending before the CA under Rule 43, the prior availability of the appeal on matters of fact and law thereon applies.

This mathematical re-computation is an error not because the new ruling on judicial review of CIAC awards is applicable to this case (as it applies prospectively) but because the amounts reimbursable to RSII were not specifically raised by the RSII as an issue in its Rule 43 petition before the CA, since the issues raised before it were confined to the release of the amount deducted by GMCLI from its Progress Billing No. 15 to cover the CWT of 2% on payments for the first 14 Progress Billings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup></p><p> In addition, that the CA made a precipitate factual conclusion of the correctness of RSII's mathematical computation over that of GMCLI after citing gossamer-thin basis perhaps betrays the general impropriety of an appellate court's review of factual findings of more specialized tribunals and quasi-judicial agencies, which were legally ascribed primacy. </p><p> As has been said, the referral of construction disputes to the CIAC is grounded on the need for construction efforts to, as far as possible, remain unfettered by lengthy and belabored court cases, and for parties in the construction industry to be given enough breathing room to maneuver the same for the farsighted benefit of national development. </p><p> Disputes such as the one presented by the petitions at bar, which to date already ran a lifespan of over four years, illustrate the need for CIAC arbitral awards to henceforth be given the authoritative sway and deference that they merit, as well as demonstrates the call for courts to stay their hands until a pure question of law can be distilled from the dispute and brought before it. </p><p> <i>The CWT Issue</i></p><p> Secondly, with regard to the tax issue, and without leaving RSII deprived of any remedy under the law, the Court finds that the CIAC, as affirmed by the CA, correctly found GMCLI to be without the authority to belatedly withhold the 2% withholding tax, but that despite the lack of authority of GMCLI to belatedly withhold and remit the 2% CWT, RSII is nevertheless still not entitled to the release of the amount equivalent to that withheld in the cumulative. </p><p> The axis of the present dispute, as well as the remaining remedy herein, lies in the definition and design of the CWT. The Expanded CWT, as defined under Section 2.57(B) of Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 2-98<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> reads: </p><blockquote> <p> (B) <i>Creditable Withholding Tax</i>. - Under the CWT system, taxes withheld on certain income payments are intended to equal or at least approximate the tax due of the payee on said income. The income recipient is still required to file an income tax return, as prescribed in Sec. 51 and Sec. 52 of the NIRC, as amended, to report the income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld and the tax due on the income. Taxes withheld on income payments covered by the expanded withholding tax (referred to in Sec. 2.57.2 of these regulations) and compensation income (referred to in Sec. 2.78 also of these regulations) are creditable in nature. </p> </blockquote> <p> Among the classifications of withholding taxes, the CWT is a tax imposed on certain income payments and is creditable against the income tax due of the payee for the taxable quarter/year in which the particular income was earned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> Essentially, the CWT is an advance income tax on the payee. Prior to the actual filing of income tax return, the taxpayer already pays a portion of its foreseeable income tax liability in the form of the creditable income tax, withheld and remitted for him on his behalf by the withholding agent. </p><p> Upon the filing of the payee's income tax return, the income of the payee which was subject to the CWT is still reported in the income tax return, for the computation of the income tax due on it. In the event that the income tax computed is more than the CWT paid earlier, the difference shall be paid by the payee in order for his income tax to be paid in full. Conversely, in case the income tax calculated is less than the CWT paid, the overpayment of CWT shall either be carried over to the next taxable period for the payee, or refunded in his favor. </p><p> RR No. 2-98, Section 2.57.3, further recites the persons required to be withholding agents, under which GMCLI falls to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 2.57.3. <i>Persons Required to Deduct and Withhold</i> - The following persons are hereby constituted as withholding agents for purposes of the creditable tax required to be withheld on income payments enumerated in Section 2.57.2: </p> <blockquote> <p> (A) In general, any judicial person, whether or not engaged in trade or business: </p> <p> x x x x</p> </blockquote> <p> <b>Agents, employees or any person purchasing goods or services, paying for and in behalf of the aforesaid withholding agents shall likewise withhold in their behalf</b>, provided that the official receipts of payments/sales invoice shall be issued in the name of the person whom the former represents and the <b>corresponding certificates of taxes withheld (BIR Form No. 2307) shall immediately be issued upon withholding of the tax.</b> </p> <p> x x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; underscoring omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Finally, the same RR likewise appoints the time when the 2% CWT should be withheld, under Section 2.57.4 thereof: </p><blockquote> <p>SECTION 2.57.4. <i>Time of Withholding</i> - The obligation of the payor to deduct and withhold the tax under Section 2.57 of the Regulations arises at the time an income payment is paid or payable, or the income payment is accrued or recorded as an expense or asset, whichever is applicable, in the payor's books, whichever comes first. The terms [sic] "payable" refers to the date the obligation becomes due, demandable or legally enforceable. </p> </blockquote> <p> The CWT's design, therefore, for tax creditability, stands on the twin conditions of the withholding agent's withholding the CWT, on the one hand, and the payee's crediting of said amount in its income tax return, on the other. </p><p> The black letter of the law is demonstrably clear and, as applied to the present case, prescribes that GMCLI should have remitted the 2% CWT as soon as each Progress Billing was paid and accordingly should have also issued the corresponding BIR Fonn 2307 to RSII in order for the latter to have had a tax credit claim on the same. GMCLI should therefore issue to RSII the pertinent BIR Form 2307 for all its belated withholding of CWT, so that RSII may exhaust the remedies available to it in the law. </p><p> It also warrants mentioning that withholding agents who delay the withholding and remittance of the CWT, are liable to pay the 25% surcharge in accordance with Section 248<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> of the National Revenue Code of 1997 (NIRC), 12% interest rate in accordance with R.A. 10963<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> or the TRAIN Law, and the compromise penalty of not less than P40,000.00, in compliance with Section 255<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> of the NIRC, and more specifically Annex A<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> of the Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 7-2015.</p><p> Finally, this dispute over the construction of a hospital has already been pending for over four years, which in the construction industry exponentially translates to increasingly damaging delay, all the more necessitating resolution at the soonest possible time.</p><p> <b><i>Conclusion</i></b></p><p> It has been said that earlier forms of arbitration predated laws and organized courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> and that contrary to the notion that arbitration modes are novel and untested, they are actually the courts' "next-of-kin",<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> perhaps even their progenitors. Along the same vein, the ability of a society to empower alternative modes of dispute resolution is a hallmark of a democracy,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> with courts exercising their ability to stay their own hands, thereby allowing space for the parties to a dispute to exercise their voluntary autonomy in the name and under the principle of expedited conflict resolutions. This need to enable the quickest and most conclusive conflict resolution possible finds exacting relevance in the case of the construction industry, with its inherently complex dynamics, and with the stakes that involve national interests, not in the least of which are public infrastructure and safety.</p><p> The attributes and functions of the CIAC also operatively place it in a hybrid classification, in that it is categorized as a quasi-judicial agency, but its very nature as an arbitral tribunal effectively places it at par with other commercial arbitral tribunals, with their characteristic speed, subject matter authoritativeness and overall autonomy. This amalgamation of its design and utilities created a whole new legal animal, which, like all things novel, poses for the Court a challenge of ascertaining its parameters and remedial routes set by law. Perhaps, unless the legislature deems it fit to create a new and independent set of rules that apply to the CIAC more responsively, the Court must continue to contend with harmonizing varying material rules, all m a manner that is as just as it is tenable under existing laws. </p><p> It is central, therefore, that the CIAC be empowered and enabled to fulfill its function as the professionally authoritative venue for settlement of construction disputes, and not straitjacketed to fit into the mold of the court system which it was meant to be an alternative of. To this end, and perhaps somewhat ironically, the courts can contribute best through non-participation, save on the narrowest of grounds. The courts are, after all, ultimately dealers of justice, more so in industries that are of greater consequence, and must remain true to this highest mandate, even if it means relinquishing review powers that, in the sum of things, it was demonstrably not meant to bear. </p><p> Further, the Court in this wise irretrievably unravels the previous hesitation to completely remove CIAC awards from the purview of Rule 43 appeals. A clear historical affirmation of their exclusion begs no other consequence, and the Court would be remiss if it insists on maintaining the existing procedural route after the same has been shown to be not only substantively counterintuitive but more so unfounded. </p><p> As has been fleshed out by the present controversy, this overarching attempt towards less court litigation and more of alternative conflict resolution in the construction industry must only get support from the Court through its own restraint, lest it be accused of being eager towards copious and lengthy litigations, or worse, indifferent to their costs. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petitions are hereby <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.

The Court here held: </p><blockquote> <p> While Rule 43 petitions may pertain to questions of fact questions of law, or both questions of law and fact, it has been established that factual findings of CIAC may not be reviewed on appeal. In <i>CE Construction v. Araneta</i>, this Court explained that appeals from CIAC may only raise questions of law:</p> <blockquote> <p> This is not to say that factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may now be assailed before the Court of Appeals. Section 3's statement "whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law" merely recognizes variances in the disparate modes of appeal that Rule 43 standardizes: that there were those that enabled questions of fact, there were those that enabled questions of law, and there were those that enabled mixed questions fact and law. Rule 43 emphasizes that though there may have been variances, all appeals under its scope are to be brought before the Court of Appeals. However, in keeping with the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, any appeal from CIAC Arbitral Tribunals must remain limited to questions of law.

The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth. (1a, 2a).</p> </blockquote> <p> Notably, the text of Rule 45, Section 1 of the present Rules of Court was different with Rule 45, Section 1 of the 1964 Rules of Court, which only referred to an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> from a final judgment of the Court of Appeals. As such, Rule 45 Section 1 of the 1964 Rules of Court had to be adopted in statutes creating and providing for appeals from certain administrative or quasi-judicial agencies, whenever the purpose was to restrict the scope of the appeal to questions of law. Fabian observed that while the intended limitation on appellate review was not fully subserved by recourse to the former Rule 45, at that time, there was no uniform rule on appeals from quasi-judicial agencies. This was exactly the case with the creation of CIAC by virtue of E.O. 1008, which was enacted on February 4, 1985. Hence, Sec. 19 thereof on Finality of Awards provided that the arbitral award shall be final and unappealable except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court.</p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> G.R.

            <p> <b><br>PERLAS-BERNABE, <i>J</i>.:</b>
            </p><p>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i>'s resulting disposition in
                this case to reinstate the Construction Industry Arbitration
                Commission's (CIAC) arbitral award with the modification to direct
                Global Medical Center of Laguna, Inc. to furnish Ross Systems
                International, Inc. the pertinent Bureau of Internal Revenue Form No.
                2307. Likewise, I agree that, as a rule of prospective application,
                there are two (2) modes of judicial review by which CIAC arbitral awards
                may be assailed henceforth, these are: <b><i><u>first</u></i></b>, a direct appeal to the Supreme Court under Rule 45 on pure questions of law; and <b><i><u>second</u></i></b>,
                an original special civil action for certiorari to the Court of Appeals
                (CA) under Rule 65 on the ground of grave abuse of discretion. <b>Nonetheless, I tender this Opinion to respectfully express my reservations against some of the <i>ponencia</i>'s discussions pertaining to this second mode of judicial review.</b>
            </p><p align="center"> <b>I.</b>
            </p><p> In particular, the <i>ponencia</i> declares that when it comes
                to the judicial review of CIAC arbitral awards under Rule 65, grave
                abuse of discretion should be further qualified into: <u>(<b><i>1</i></b>) a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal</u> (<i>i.e</i>., award is procured through fraud, corruption, undue means, or evident partiality on the part of the arbitrators, <i>etc</i>.); and <u><b>(<i>2</i>)</b></u> an allegation of the arbitral tribunal&#8217;s violation of the Constitution or positive law.</p><p> The first qualification of "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" has been  proposed by the <i>ponencia</i> as a<b> necessary form of contraction of grave abuse of discretion</b> that is supposedly warranted by the "unequivocal intent" of the pertinent laws on CIAC arbitration:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Therefore, in the instant case and for purposes of judicial review of the CIAC arbitral awards, <b><u>this
                    Court now divines Rule 65, being confined to challenges only to the
                    arbitral tribunal's integrity or allegations of its actions'
                    unconstitutionality or illegality, to be a warranted contraction of the
                    breadth of the concept of 'grave abuse of discretion', in order to
                    harmonize a Rule 65 resort with the unequivocal intent of E.O. 1008, and
                    other relevant laws, including R.A. 876 and R.A. 9285, which apply
                    supplementarily</u></b>. To be sure, although E.O. 1008 applies
                    specifically to the CIAC as a specialized arbitral institution for the
                    construction industry, nothing precludes the Court from applying the
                    umbrella legislation of R.A. 876 and its significant amendment, R.A.
                    9285. </p>
                <p> x x x x</p>
                <p> Evidently therefore, the intent of the relevant laws with
                    respect to the treatment of arbitral awards is two-tiered: first, that
                    they are final as far as their appreciation of the facts that go into
                    the merit of the dispute is concerned; and second, in case of obvious
                    errors of facts (<i>e.g</i>., miscalculations), they are modifiable or
                    correctible only insofar as they do not affect the merits of the
                    controversy. Such is the restrained attitude that courts were intended
                    to maintain with respect to arbitral awards. Such purposively narrow
                    windows for changing the arbitral tribunal's award are most in
                    consonance with the confined posture towards appeals as unambiguously
                    provided for by E.O. 1008, and as fleshed out by R.A. 9285 and the
                    Special ADR Rules. </p>
                <p> x x x x </p>
                <p> This harmonization is most consistent with the spirit of the law
                    which created the CIAC, as was reaffirmed by R.A. 9285 and the Special
                    ADR Rules. Accordingly, all rules and regulations that allow the
                    contrary, including the pertinent provisions in the Revised
                    Administrative Circular No. 1-95, Rule 43 of the Rules and the CIAC
                    Rules, should be deemed amended to conform to the rule on direct resort
                    to this Court on pure questions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The <i>ponencia</i> further elaborates the need for such qualification:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Further, the resort to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under
                    Rule 65 is confined to assailing the integrity of the arbitral tribunal
                    based on any of the aforementioned factual scenarios (<i>e.g.</i>,
                    corruption, fraud, evident partiality of the tribunal), or the
                    constitutionality or legality of the conduct of the arbitration process,
                    <b><u>and may not remain unqualified as to embrace other badges of grave abuse</u></b>. x x x</p>
                <p> x x x x</p>
                <p> However, far from being static, the very contours of what
                    constitutes grave abuse of discretion have always been traced by the
                    Court in a judicious but fragmentary manner, as called for by each case
                    in jurisprudence. Distinctively, therefore, although the remedy of
                    petition for <i>certiorari</i>, as the procedural vehicle, is
                    purposefully rigid and unyielding in order to avoid overextension of the
                    same over situations that do not raise an error of jurisdiction, the
                    concept of grave abuse of discretion which must be alleged to avail of
                    the <i>certiorari</i> remedy is, in the same degree, deliberately
                    flexible, in order to enable it to capture a whole spectrum of
                    permutations of grave abuse. <b><u>If the case were otherwise, <i>i.e.</i>, if the concept of grave abuse were rigid, and the <i>certiorari</i>
                        remedy loose, the same would be exposed to the possibility of having a
                        clear act of whim and caprice placed beyond the ambit of the court's <i>certiorari</i> power because of a definitional discomfiture in the legal procedure</u></b>. </p>
                <p> x x x x </p>
                <p> Indicatively, going by the jurisprudential construction of grave
                    abuse of discretion as contemplated by Rule 65, the same decidedly
                    casts a wider net than that which is consistent with the narrower
                    confines of factual review of CIAC arbitral awards, and covers numerous
                    other scenarios apart from that which may amount to a challenge of the
                    integrity of a tribunal. The above cases demonstrate badges of grave
                    abuse that could not have been contemplated as far as factual review of
                    CIAC awards is concerned. To leave this Rule 65 resort unqualified is,
                    therefore, to leave it overinclusive, at the expense of the weight and
                    conclusiveness of findings of fact of the CIAC. Stated differently,
                    precisely because challenging the integrity, constitutionality or
                    legality of the tribunal or its actions in the arbitral process are only
                    some of the many permutations of grave abuse within the construction of
                    Rule 65, the delimitation is crucial for purposes of factual review of
                    CIAC arbitral awards, if a resort to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is to be made consistent with E.O. 1008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> While I have no qualms about the possibility of
                contracting/qualifying grave abuse of discretion into a narrower
                permutation, it is my view that the same must be justified by the
                Constitution or the law. Indeed, it is my position that absent any clear
                constitutional or statutory basis, the Court should not contract grave
                abuse of discretion. </p><p> As will be explained herein, there is
                simply no constitutional or statutory basis that warrants the
                contraction of grave abuse of discretion into the <i>ponencia</i>'s qualification of "a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal," therefore, the <i>ponencia</i>'s qualification/contraction of grave abuse of discretion is not justified. </p><p> To recount, "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" is a term that was first coined in the case of <i>CE Construction Corporation v. Araneta Center, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (<i>CE Construction</i>).
                The term is, in concept, a collective category that was meant to
                encapsulate the grounds stated under Section 24 of Republic Act No. (RA)
                876<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (<b>Section 24 grounds</b>), or the general Arbitration Law of 1953. These grounds are as follows:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> (a) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; or</p>
                <p> (b) That there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or any of them; or</p>
                <p> (c) That the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing
                    to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to
                    hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; that one or
                    more of the arbitrators was disqualified to act as such under section
                    nine hereof, and willfully refrained from disclosing such
                    disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any
                    party have been materially prejudiced; or</p>
                <p> (d) That the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so
                    imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon
                    the subject matter submitted to them was not made. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The difference between <i>CE Construction</i> and the <i>ponencia</i>
                is that the former merely adopted previous jurisprudence which referred
                to the Section 24 grounds as mere prototypical examples. </p><p> Upon careful scrutiny, the <i>ponencia</i>, in some of its parts, has referred to the said grounds as prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
                however, in other parts, it perceives "integrity of the arbitral
                tribunal" not as mere examples, but in itself, a contracted version of
                grave abuse of discretion. These latter portions do not only create the
                impression that the Section 24 grounds are the exclusive grounds to
                assail a CIAC arbitral award, but also renders the <i>ponencia</i> inconsistent.</p><p>
                This inconsistency becomes more magnified by the fact that it takes
                great pains to justify the bases for contracting grave abuse of
                discretion into a "challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal"
                (to the extent of delving into the boundaries of the Court's rule-making
                power under the Constitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>), but, in the end, ultimately recognizes that, as stated above, "<u>the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law</u>" is an accepted ground to assail a CIAC arbitral award under Rule 65.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> To be sure, this latter recognition was actually a modification of the original <i>ponencia</i>, which was borne from my submissions during the deliberations in this case, which I have presented in this wise:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Essentially, while I concur in the <i>ponencia</i>'s result, I
                    express reservations on its proposal to contract grave abuse of
                    discretion into a narrower permutation called "integrity of the arbitral
                    tribunal" insofar as <i>certiorari </i>challenges against Construction
                    Industry Arbitration  Commission (CIAC) arbitral awards are concerned.
                    It is my submission that absent any clear constitutional or statutory
                    basis, the Court should not contract grave abuse of discretion,
                    especially considering the repercussions of this novel approach to other
                    cases. Instead, when it comes to CIAC arbitration, it is already
                    settled that the grounds under Section 24 of Republic Act No. (RA) 876
                    (to which the phrase "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" collectively
                    refers to) are only treated as prototypical examples and not exclusive
                    grounds, by and of themselves. <b><u>To contract grave abuse into the
                        above-stated narrower form is to exclude from judicial review other
                        permissible grounds that also constitute jurisdictional errors, such as
                        "when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the
                        law or existing jurisprudence.</u></b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> As the present <i>ponencia</i> now recognizes that a restriction of Rule 65 exclusively to the Section 24 grounds (<i>i.e.</i>,
                challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal) would be
                problematic in that it may "exclude from judicial review other
                permissible grounds that also constitute jurisdictional errors, such as
                'when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the
                law or existing jurisprudence,"' it now expressly acknowledges that "an
                allegation of a violation of the Constitution or positive law" is a
                ground to assail CIAC arbitral awards via Rule 65:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Far from being absolute, however, the general rule proscribing
                    against judicial review of factual matters admits of exceptions, with
                    the standing litmus test that which <b><u>pertain to either a challenge

                    exceptionally trigger a factual review of the CIAC's arbitral awards,
                    the Court here discerns the merit in adding the otherwise forgotten
                    presumption that factual findings of the CIAC arbitral tribunal may also
                    be revisited by the Court upon an allegation that the arbitral tribunal
                    committed an act that is violative of the Constitution or other

                    tribunal, however narrow, are still principally tethered to the courts'
                    primary duty of upholding the Constitution and positive laws. The
                    addition of the second ground makes plain that no amount of contracting
                    or expanding grounds for grave abuse will ever be permitted to lay waste

            </blockquote>
            <p> It should be highlighted that the arbitral tribunal's "violation of the Constitution or positive law" is just a <b>reiteration of the traditional notion of grave abuse of discretion as per the prevailing case law on Rule 65.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> This traditional notion of grave abuse of discretion has been consistently applied to cases elevated on <i>certiorari</i> in general.</p><p> Thus, as may be gleaned from the above-cited passage in the <i>ponencia</i>, it, <b><u>on the one hand</u></b>, purports to contract grave abuse of discretion into <u>very limited grounds</u> (<i>i.e</i>., challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal) <b><u>but in the same breath</u></b>, recognizes that a CIAC arbitral award may nonetheless be assailed by <u>the general and traditional conception</u> of grave abuse of discretion (<i>i.e</i>., allegation of the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law). <b>With all due respect, this approach is clearly inconsistent, as it begs the question</b> &#8211; <i>Is
                the Rule 65 ground to assail a CIAC arbitral award, (1) a specifically
                contracted ground (i.e., challenge on the integrity of the arbitral
                tribunal); (2) a general ground as grave abuse of discretion has been
                understood to apply in all other cases in general (i.e., allegation of
                the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law):
                or (3) is it</i> <i>both?</i> More so, it is observed that if the
                <i>ponencia</i> already recognizes that CIAC arbitral awards can already be
                assailed by the traditional conception of grave abuse of discretion,
                then there is no more practical value to contract/calibrate grave abuse
                of discretion into a limited ground.
            </p><p> Furthermore, the <i>ponencia</i>'s discussions on "challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal" is equally inconsistent: <b><i><u>on the one hand</u></i></b>, it deems that the Section 24 grounds falling under such term are <u>mere prototypical examples</u>; but <b><i><u>on the other hand</u></i></b>, it labels them as "<u>contracted</u>" or "<u>very limited grounds</u>." "Prototypical" means "having the typical qualities of a particular group or kind of person or thing[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, when something is a mere "prototypical example," it is only a prime example of a greater class, <i>i.e.</i>,
                grave abuse of discretion, and hence, not exclusive or exhaustive of
                said class. In contrast, when the treatment is that the Section 24
                grounds are, by and of themselves, contracted grounds, then the said
                grounds are deemed exclusive and exhaustive, so as not to allow other
                instances of grave abuse of discretion to assail a CIAC arbitral award.
                Overall, one may therefore ask &#8211; <i>Are the grounds under Section 24 to
                    assail a CIAC arbitral award, exclusive or not? Or are they hath
                    exclusive and not exclusive since after all a litigant may assail a CIAC
                    arbitral award based on the traditional conception of grave abuse,<i> i.e.,</i> allegation of the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution or positive law?</i>
            </p><p> Respectfully, I am impelled to point out these inconsistencies
                (which I have, in fact, already identified during the deliberations of
                this case<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> but to no avail)
                if only to draw attention to the possible confusion that this may cause
                aggrieved litigants who wish to assail CIAC arbitral awards.

            </p><p> In any case, I submit that, in the final analysis, <b>there is really no basis to contract grave abuse of discretion into a "<i>challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal</i>" because the grounds under Section 24 of RA 876, refer to a different remedy, <i>i.e.</i>, a motion to vacate, and not a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, which remedy is, in fact, unavailable in arbitration proceedings instituted before the CIAC</b>. </p><p> To expound, Section 26, in relation to Section 24, of RA 876 states:

                    CIAC. Petitioner erroneously relied on the provision in said law
                    allowing any party to a domestic arbitration to file in the Regional
                    Trial Court (RTC) a petition either to confirm, correct or vacate a
                    domestic arbitral award.</p>
                <p> We hold that R.A. No. 9285 did not confer on regional trial
                    courts jurisdiction to review awards or decisions of the CIAC in
                    construction disputes. On the contrary, Section 40 thereof expressly
                    declares that confirmation by the RTC is not required, thus:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> SEC. 40. <i>Confirmation of Award</i>. -  The confirmation of a domestic arbitral award shall be governed by Section 23 of R.A. 876.</p>
                    <p> A domestic arbitral award when confirmed shall be enforced in
                        the same manner as final and executory decisions of the Regional Trial
                        Court.</p>
                    <p> The confirmation of a domestic award shall be made by the
                        regional trial court in accordance with the Rules of Procedure to be
                        promulgated by the Supreme Court. </p>
                    <p> A CIAC arbitral award need not be confirmed by the regional trial court to be executory as provided under E.O. No. 1008.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p> Executive Order (EO) No. 1008 vests upon the CIAC original and
                    exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with,
                    contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the
                    Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion
                    of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. By express
                    provision of Section 19 thereof, the arbitral award of the CIAC is final
                    and unappealable, except on questions of law, which are appealable to
                    the Supreme Court. x x x</p>
                <p> Petitioner misread the provisions of A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC
                    (Special ADR Rules) promulgated by this Court and which took effect on
                    October 10, 2009. Since R.A. No. 9285 explicitly excluded CIAC awards
                    from domestic arbitration awards that need to be confirmed to be
                    executory, said awards are therefore <b><u>not covered by Rule 11</u></b> of the Special ADR Rules[, entitled RULE 11: CONFIRMATION, CORRECTION OR <b><u>VACATION</u></b>

            <p> Under the CIAC Law, the only remedy stated is a Rule 45 appeal to the Supreme Court pure questions of law:

            <p> Notably, <b>the CIAC Law and the CIAC Rules did not explicitly or

                in order to vacate a domestic arbitral award. Instead, Section 41 of RA
                9285 expressly states that the grounds to vacate a domestic arbitral
                award shall be "only on those grounds enumerated in Section 25 of [RA]
                876" or those grounds to correct or modify an award found in the old
                law. The same provision states that "[a]ny other ground raised x x x
                shall be disregarded by the Regional Trial Court."</p><p> Neither does
                existing jurisprudence furnish sufficient basis for RA 876's suppletory
                application to CIAC arbitration. To be sure, the <i>ponencia</i> cites the 2003 case of <i>LM Power Engineering Corporation v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
                to justify the applicability of Section 24 of RA 876 in CIAC
                arbitration. However, upon careful study, the Court, in the said case, <b><i><u>merely  suggested</u></i></b>
                that RA 876, pursuant to Section 7 thereof, be applied to stay the
                regular court proceeding (in which the complaint was first filed) and <b>not the CIAC arbitration proceedings</b>.
                This remedy was suggested so that the arbitration proceedings could
                continue in the CIAC, which continues to be solely governed by the CIAC
                Law and the corresponding CIAC Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Nonetheless, as already held in the more recent 2013 case of <i>J Plus</i>,
                the Court already clarified that when it comes to CIAC arbitration, the
                CIAC Law and CIAC Rules govern, and not the general arbitration law, <i>i.e</i>., RA 9285 amending RA 876.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
            </p><p>Based on the foregoing, it is therefore clear that there is no constitutional or statutory basis to justify the <i>ponencia</i>'s contraction of grave abuse of discretion into a narrower permutation thereof, <i>i.e</i>., a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal.
            </p><p align="center"> <b>II.</b>
            </p><p> If anything, the Section 24 grounds encompassing the phrase <b>"a challenge on the integrity of the arbitral tribunal" are mere prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion</b>. As mentioned, the <i>ponencia</i>
                is inconsistent on this matter. But to settle the matter once and for
                all, it should be made clear that existing case law has, all the while,
                held that the Section 24 grounds are mere prototypical examples and not
                exclusive Rule 65 grounds. This is evident from the cases of <i>Hi-Precision Steel Center, Inc. v. Lim Kim Steel Builders, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (<i>Hi-Precision</i>) and <i>Spouses David v. CIAC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (<i>Sps.

                upon the artful allegation that such body had 'misapprehended the
                facts' and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of
                fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as 'legal
                questions."'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> On this score, it referred to the Section 24 grounds as <b>prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion</b>:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor
                    field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that
                    matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties
                    in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private
                    purposes. The Court will not review the factual findings of an arbitral
                    tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had "misapprehended
                    the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of
                    fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as "legal
                    questions." The parties here had recourse to arbitration and chose the
                    arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in such
                    arbitrators. <b>The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to
                        relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued

                            is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal
                            committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to

                            examples would be factual conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in

                            its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through

                    relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a
                    voluntary arbitration and would reduce arbitration to a largely inutile

            </blockquote>
            <p> <i>Hi-Precision</i> was later cited in the 2004 case of <i>Sps. David</i>
                where the Court likewise stressed the general rule that factual
                findings of an arbitral tribunal should not be disturbed. To flesh out
                this point, the Court quoted the pronouncement in <i>Hi-Precision</i> that the Section 24 grounds were mere prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p> Eventually, in 2017, the Court promulgated <i>CE Construction</i>, where the phrase "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" was inspired from by the<em> ponencia</em>. Similar to its predecessor cases, <i>CE Construction</i>
                never characterized the Section 24 grounds as the exclusive grounds of
                grave abuse of discretion. Rather, in coining the phrase "integrity of
                the arbitral tribunal," <i>CE Construction</i> only emphasized that
                "factual findings may be reviewed only in cases where the CIAC arbitral
                tribunals conducted their affairs in a haphazard, immodest manner that
                the most basic integrity of the arbitral process was imperiled."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
            </p><p> In the same light, the Court, in <i>Tondo Medical</i>, citing <i>Sps. David</i>,
                held that "factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and
                conclusive and not reviewable by this Court on appeal, except when the
                petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the award was procured by
                corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality
                or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators
                were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon
                sufficient cause shown. or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and
                material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were
                disqualified to act as such under section nine of Republic Act No. 876
                and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any
                other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially
                prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so
                imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon
                the subject matter submitted to them was not made."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Again, as in previous cases, the Court, in <i>Tondo Medical</i>, never made any qualification that these grounds are contracted permutations of grave abuse of discretion.
            </p><p> Thus, contrary to the <i>ponencia</i>, there is actually no
                case that can be cited as authority to support its notion that the
                Section 24 grounds were already "exported" or "appropriated"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> by statutory or case law when it comes to CIAC arbitration.</p><p>
                In fact, aside from the above-stated cases which merely treated the
                Section 24 grounds as prototypical examples, the Court, in the latest
                2020 case of <i>Department of Public Works and Highways v. Italian-Thai Development Public Company, Ltd</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (<i>DPWH</i>), citing <i>Shinryo (Phils.) Company, Inc. v. RRN, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (<i>Shinryo</i>), expressly declared that <strong><u>grounds other than those in Section 24 of RA 876 may constitute grave abuse of discretion in CIAC arbitration proceedings</u></strong>. In <i>Shinryo</i>, the Court reiterated that:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> It is settled that findings of fact of quasi-judicial bodies,
                    which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to
                    specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect, but also
                    finality, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals. In
                    particular, factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and
                    conclusive and nor reviewable by this Court on appeal. </p>
                <p> This rule, however, admits of certain exceptions. In <i>Uniwide Sales Realty and Resources Corporation v. Titan-Ikeda Construction and Development Corporation</i> [540 Phil. 350 (2006)], we said:</p>

                    the petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the award was procured by
                    corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality
                    or corruption of the arbitrators or any of them; (3) the arbitrators
                    were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and
                    material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were
                    disqualified to act as such under Section nine of Republic Act No. 876

            </blockquote>
            <p align="center"> <b>III.</b>
            </p><p> In fine, absent any clear constitutional or statutory basis, the <i>ponencia</i>'s contraction of grave abuse of discretion is not justified. </p><p> Furthermore, as herein discussed, the<i> ponencia</i>'s contraction creates a logical inconsistency, considering how its discussions contain both the general rule (<i>i.e</i>., violation of the Constitution and positive law) and a specific rule (<i>i.e.,</i> challenging the integrity of the arbitral tribunal). This inconsistency becomes more problematic with the <i>ponencia</i>'s
                categorization of Section 24 of RA 876 as both a source of exclusive
                grounds and prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion in CIAC
                arbitration proceedings, which this Opinion has clarified to be deemed
                as only prototypical examples consistent with prevailing case law.
                Indeed, albeit its noble intentions, this endeavor leads to more
                confusion than a definite calibration.</p><p> And finally, the <i>ponencia</i>'s contraction is also unnecessary since it creates the impression that there are two (2) ways in order to obtain the remedy of <i>certiorari</i>
                under Rule 65 when in fact the ground of challenging the integrity of
                the arbitral tribunal should already fall within the traditional
                understanding of grave abuse of discretion. In my view, the traditional
                conception of grave abuse of discretion already subsumes the term
                "integrity of the arbitral tribunal" since after all, an arbitral award
                procured through fraud, corruption, undue means, or evident partiality
                on the part of the arbitrators,<i> etc.</i> is tantamount to the tribunal's violation of the Constitution and positive law. </p><p> Ultimately, it is discerned that the <i>ponencia</i>'s
                motivation for contracting grave abuse of discretion is to promote the
                policy of deference to party autonomy and to accord respect to the
                CIAC's factual findings due to its expertise on the matter.
                Nevertheless, with all due respect, the solution to this should not be
                made at the expense of stretching the law and settled jurisprudence. To
                my mind, the more prudent approach would be to strictly exhort courts to

                extraordinary nature, especially when it comes to assailing factual

            <p> All told, while I agree in the result, I dissent against the <i>ponencia</i>'s
                pronouncements pertaining to the contraction of grave abuse of
                discretion. To recapitulate, my disagreement can be summarized into
                three (3) points: (<i>a</i>) there is no clear constitutional or
                statutory basis that justifies the contraction of grave abuse of
                discretion when it comes to a Rule 65 review of CIAC arbitral awards; (<i>b</i>) the <i>ponencia</i>
                already acknowledges that the instances mentioned in Section 24 of RA
                876 are mere prototypical examples of grave abuse of discretion and
                hence, should not be deemed as exclusive grounds therefor; and (<i>c</i>) the <i>ponencia</i>
                already considers the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution
                or positive law as a ground to assail CIAC arbitral awards on <i>certiorari</i>
                and hence, a party may already assail a CIAC arbitral award based on
                grave abuse of discretion's traditional conception that perforce negates
                its further contraction, which after all, lacks basis in law.<br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT">

                <p>[D]espite the above-stated changes in the <i>ponencia</i>, I must
                    respectfully point out that the <i>ponencia</i> still retains its previous
                    discussions made in refutation of my Reflections, which, to my mind, are
                    inconsistent with its current position already recognizing violations
                    of the Constitution and the law as grounds to assail a CIAC arbitral
                    award, in addition to the ground of integrity of the arbitral tribunal,
                    which ground contemplates the situations listed under Section 24 of RA
                    876 only as prototypical examples. Specifically, these discussions
                    pertain, in essence, to the following points: (<i>a</i>) Section 24 of RA 876 must be replicated as the limited grounds to assail a CIAC arbitral award x x x; (<i>b</i>)
                    pursuant to the Court's rule-making power, the "elastic" concept of
                    grave abuse of discretion permits a narrow contraction of grave abuse of
                    discretion to the exclusive grounds listed under Section 24 of RA 876 x
                    x x; and (<i>c</i>) the relevant laws (<i>e.g</i>. RA 876, RA 9285,
                    Special ADR Rules) supposedly demonstrate a clear legislative intent to
                    contract grave abuse of discretion only to the grounds listed under
                    Section 24 of RA 876 x x x (collectively referred to as "subject
                    discussions"). </p>
                <p> To my mind, the subject discussions in the <i>ponencia</i> are inconsistent with its current position that (<i>a</i>)
                    the grounds in Section 24 of RA 876 are not exclusive grounds but only
                    prototypical examples that affect the integrity of the tribunal; and (<i>b</i>) <i>certiorari</i>
                    challenges are allowed if there are constitutional or legal violations.
                    Anent the latter, the ground of violation of the Constitution or
                    positive law is not a peculiar ground listed in Section 24 of RA 876,
                    but is one which squares with the more traditional understanding of
                    grave abuse of discretion, <i>i.e</i>., where there is a patent
                    violation of the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence. As such, for
                    the sake of consistency, it is respectfully requested that these
                    discussions be revisited. Ultimately, the subject discussions all
                    purport to contract grave abuse of discretion to the peculiar grounds
                    listed in Section 24 of RA 876; this contraction
                    is, however, not necessary anymore since the present version of the
                    <i>ponencia</i> already goes beyond the ambit of Section 24 by recognizing that
                    the arbitral tribunal's violation of the Constitution and the law are
                    grounds to assail the arbitral award.

                    to "untangl[e] the relevant laws and case pronouncements on the extent
                    of judicial review of [Construction Industry Arbitration Commission
                    (CIAC)] arbitral awards[,] [and come to] a decisive harmonization of the
                    standing laws on CIAC review[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p> With this opportunity, I write separately to amplify points previously articulated in <i>CE Construction Corporation v. Araneta Center, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and other decisions in which I had served as <i>ponente</i>. These had been referenced by the present <i>ponencia</i> as informing its conclusions.</p><p>
                An immense degree of deference is due to the findings of arbitral
                tribunals of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC).
                The law that created the CIAC, Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known
                as the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, delineates appellate
                jurisdiction from rulings of CIAC arbitral tribunals. It stipulates that
                appeals from such rulings may only be entertained on pure questions of
                law and only before this Court.</p><p> Thus, Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules
                of Civil Procedure&#8212;a provision of procedural, and not of substantive
                law, which is ill-equipped to vest jurisdiction&#8212;is mistaken in allowing
                appeals to be taken to the Court of  Appeals.</p><p> Still, CIAC
                arbitral tribunals' factual findings are not entirely beyond the reach
                of judicial review. The capacity to pass upon any "grave abuse of
                discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of
                any branch	or 	instrumentality 	of the 	Government"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
                is 		a 	constitutionally&shy; enshrined, inalienable dimension of judicial
                power.  Thus, a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 65&#8212;over
                which the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction&#8212;can touch upon factual
                findings in CIAC arbitral tribunal rulings. </p><p> Nevertheless,
                entertaining Rule 65 petitions must entail an extraordinarily narrow
                conception of grave abuse of discretion committed by CIAC arbitral
                tribunals. Entertaining such petitions must be consistent with our
                general framework on vacating arbitral awards, as seminally expressed in
                Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876, otherwise known as the Arbitration
                Law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p> Thus, in the
                context of a Rule 65 petition, the Court of Appeals can review the
                factual findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals only "in instances when the
                integrity of the arbitral tribunal itself has been put in jeopardy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p>
                In addition, because of the basic primacy of the Constitution and the
                imperative of harmonious application of laws, the Court of Appeals may
                also review factual findings when there is grave abuse of discretion
                made by way of violation of the Constitution or our laws. Review of
                factual findings on any ground which goes into considerations other than
                the very integrity of a CIAC arbitral tribunal (as contemplated in
                Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876) or those tribunals' outright
                violation of the Constitution or laws is an excessive, invalid review
                via certiorari.</p><p align="center"> <b>I</b>

            </p><blockquote>
                <p> The Construction Industry Arbitration Commission was a creation
                    of Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction
                    Industry Arbitration Law. At inception, it was under the administrative
                    supervision of the Philippine Domestic Construction Board which, in
                    turn, was an implementing agency of the Construction Industry Authority
                    of the Philippines (CIAP). The CIAP is presently attached to the
                    Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
                <p> The CIAC was created with the specific purpose of an "early and
                    expeditious settlement of disputes" cognizant of the exceptional role of
                    construction to "the furtherance of national development goals."</p>
                <p> Section 4 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Law spells out the jurisdiction of the CIAC:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> Section 4. Jurisdiction. &#8212; The CIAC shall have original and
                        exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with,
                        contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the
                        Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion
                        of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These
                        disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to
                        acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the
                        same to voluntary arbitration.</p>
                    <p> The jurisdiction of the CIAC may include but is not limited to
                        violation of specifications for materials and workmanship; violation of

                <p> The CIAC is a statutory creation. It was created by an executive
                    order promulgated by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos (President
                    Marcos) in  the exercise of legislative powers which were then lodged in
                    him. The statute that created it spelled out not only the CIAC's
                    jurisdiction in its Section 4, but also the finality of CIAC decisions
                    and mode of appeal in its Section 19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> <i>CE Construction</i>
                detailed the intricacies of the CIAC as a statutory creation, even
                though President Marcos did not use the usual modality (i.e.,
                presidential decree) of his legislative enactments:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Though nominally an "executive order," the Construction Industry Arbitration Law is a statute. </p>
                <p> Jurisprudence has clarified that, in exercising legislative
                    powers, then President Marcos did not only use the modality of
                    presidential decrees, but also of executive orders and letters of
                    instruction. Though, this is not to say that all executive orders and
                    letters of instruction issued by him are statutes. </p>
                <p> In <i>Parong, et al. v. Enrile</i>: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> To form part of the law of the land, the decree, order or
                        [letter of instruction] must be issued by the President in the exercise
                        of his extraordinary power of legislation as contemplated in Section 6
                        of the 1976 amendments to the Constitution, whenever in his judgment,
                        there exists a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or
                        whenever the interim Batasan[g] Pambansa or the regular National
                        Assembly fails or is unable to act adequately on any matter for any
                        reason that in his judgment requires immediate action. </p>

                <p> Associate Justice Irene Cortes noted that certain executive
                    orders and letters of instruction have indeed been on par with President
                    Marcos' more commonly used mode of legislation (i.e., presidential
                    decrees): </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> Another problem arises from lack of precision in the
                        appropriate use of one form of issuance as against another. A
                        presidential decree is equivalent to a statute enacted by the
                        legislature, and is thus superior to implementing rules issued as
                        executive orders or letter of instructions. But, it is not unheard, of
                        for an executive order to amend or repeal a presidential decree or a
                        letter of instructions to amend an executive order, or lay down a rule
                        of law. </p>

                <p> Associate Justice Cortes specifically cited as an example Exec.

                    Studies, a creation of Pres. Decree No. 342 (1973). In disproving that
                    Exec. Order No. 543 was issued merely as an implementing rule, she
                    explained that its object - a state university - could not have fallen
                    under the scope of the President's reorganization powers, for which an
                    executive order issued merely as an implementing rule was sufficient. </p>
                <p> The Construction Industry Arbitration Law's own nomenclature
                    reveals the intent that it be a statute. Its whereas clauses and
                    declaration of policy reveal the urgency that impelled immediate action
                    for the President to exercise his concurrent legislative powers. </p>
                <p> Any doubt on the statutory efficacy of the Construction Industry
                    Arbitration Law is addressed by Congress' own, voluntary and repeated

                </p><blockquote>
                <p> The CIAC does not only serve the interest of speedy dispute resolution, it also facilitates <i>authoritative</i>
                    dispute resolution. Its authority proceeds not only from juridical
                    legitimacy but equally from technical expertise. The creation of a
                    special adjudicatory body for construction disputes presupposes
                    distinctive and nuanced competence on matters that are conceded to be
                    outside the innate expertise of regular courts and adjudicatory bodies
                    concerned with other specialized fields. The CIAC has the state's
                    confidence concerning the entire technical expanse of construction,
                    defined in jurisprudence as "referring to all on-site works on buildings
                    or altering structures, from land clearance through completion
                    including excavation, erection and assembly and installation of

                <p> Jurisprudence has characterized the CIAC as a quasi-judicial,
                    administrative agency equipped with technical proficiency that enables
                    it to efficiently and promptly resolve conflicts: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> [The CIAC] is a quasi-judicial agency. A quasi-judicial agency
                        or body has been defined as an organ of government other than a court
                        and other than a legislature, which affects the rights of private
                        parties through either adjudication or rule-making. The very definition
                        of an administrative agency includes its being vested with
                        quasi-judicial powers. The ever increasing variety of powers and
                        functions given to administrative agencies recognizes the need for the
                        active intervention of administrative agencies in matters calling for
                        technical knowledge and speed in countless controversies which cannot
                        possibly be handled by regular courts. The CIAC's primary function is
                        that of a quasi-judicial agency, which is to adjudicate claims and/or
                        determine rights in accordance with procedures set forth in E.O. No.
                        1008. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p> The most recent jurisprudence maintains that the CIAC is a quasi-judicial body. This Court's November 23, 2016 Decision in <i>Fruehauf Electronics v. Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific</i>
                    distinguished construction arbitration, as well as voluntary
                    arbitration pursuant to Article 219(14) of the Labor Code, from
                    commercial arbitration. It ruled that commercial arbitral tribunals are
                    not quasi-judicial agencies, as they are purely ad hoc bodies operating
                    through contractual consent and as they intend to serve private,
                    proprietary interests. In contrast, voluntary arbitration under the
                    Labor Code and construction arbitration operate through the statutorily
                    vested jurisdiction of government instrumentalities that exist
                    independently of the will of contracting parties and to which these
                    parties submit. They proceed from the public interest imbuing their
                    respective spheres: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> Voluntary Arbitrators resolve labor disputes and grievances
                        arising from the interpretation of Collective Bargaining Agreements.
                        These disputes were specifically excluded from the coverage of both the
                        Arbitration Law and the ADR Law. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p> Unlike purely commercial relationships, the relationship between
                    capital and labor are heavily impressed with public interest. Because
                    of this, Voluntary Arbitrators authorized to resolve labor disputes have
                    been clothed with quasi-judicial authority. </p>
                <p> On 	the 	other 	hand, 	commercial 		relationships covered by our
                    commercial arbitration laws are purely private 	and	contractual 	in
                    nature.  Unlike 	labor relationships, they do not possess the same
                    compelling state interest that would justify state interference into the
                    autonomy of contracts. Hence, commercial arbitration is a purely
                    private system of adjudication facilitated by private citizens instead
                    of government instrumentalities wielding quasi-judicial powers. </p>
                <p> Moreover, judicial or quasi-judicial jurisdiction cannot be
                    conferred upon a tribunal by the parties alone. The Labor Code itself
                    confers subject-matter jurisdiction to Voluntary Arbitrators. </p>
                <p> <i>Notably, the other arbitration body listed in Rule 43 &#8212; the

                </p><p> In view of the CIAC's unique technical expertise, primacy and
                immense deference is accorded to CIAC arbitral tribunal decisions. This
                means that there can only be "a very narrow room for assailing [their]
                rulings."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Accordingly,
                Section 19 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Law provides that
                CIAC arbitral awards cannot be assailed, except on pure questions of law
                and only before this Court:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> SECTION 19. Finality of Awards. &#8212; The arbitral award shall be
                    binding upon the parties. It shall be final and inappealable except on
                    questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court.</p>
            </blockquote>
                <p> Since the Construction Industry Arbitration Law's adoption in
                    1985, procedural law and related jurisprudence have made it appear that
                    appeals may also be taken to the Court of Appeals. There, the factual
                    findings of CIAC arbitral tribunals may supposedly be assailed. This has
                    been an unfortunate mistake. The Court of Appeals' supposed appellate
                    jurisdiction to freely review factual issues finds no basis in
                    substantive law.
                </p><p> On February 27, 1991, this Court adopted Circular No. 1-91,
                "Prescribing the Rules Governing Appeals to the Court of Appeals from a
                Final Order or Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals and Quasi-Judicial
                Agencies."</p><p> Section 3 of Circular No. 1-91 enabled appeals from
                decisions of quasi-judicial agencies to be taken to the Court of Appeals
                on questions of fact, questions of law, or both questions of fact and
                law. Section 1 made this recourse available in all cases where appeals
                were "allowed by statute to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court."
                Further, Section 1 also listed some quasi-judicial agencies whose
                decisions may be appealed to the Court of Appeals. This enumeration did
                not include the CIAC. Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Circular No. 1-91 read:

                    Appeals within the period in the manner herein provided, whether the
                    appeal involved questions of fact or of law or mixed questions of fact
                    and law. From final judgments or decisions of the Court of Appeals, the
                    aggrieved party may appeal by certiorari to the Supreme Court as
                    provided in Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.</p>

                <p> The rules stated in Circular No. 1-95 were formally included in

                    As with Circular No. 1-95, Rule 43, Section 1 expressly includes the
                    CIAC as among those quasi-judicial agencies whose awards and judgments
                    may be appealed to the Court of Appeals. </p><p> This Court's 2001 Decision in <i>Metro Construction v. Chatham Properties</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
                offers a rationalization for why CIAC awards may supposedly be appealed
                to the Court of Appeals. There, this Court alluded to a "procedural
                mutation" from Circular No. 1-91, to Circular No. 1-95, and through to
                the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. It also cited Republic Act No. 7902
                as statutory basis:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Through Circular No. 1-91, the Supreme Court intended to
                    establish a uniform procedure for the review of the final orders or
                    decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals and other quasi-judicial agencies
                    provided that an appeal therefrom is then allowed under existing
                    statutes to either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. The
                    Circular designated the Court of Appeals as the reviewing body to
                    resolve questions of fact or of law or mixed questions of fact and law. </p>
                <p> It is clear that Circular No. 1-91 covers the CIAC. In the first
                    place, it is a quasi-judicial agency. A quasi-judicial agency or body
                    has been defined as an organ of government other than a court and other
                    than a legislature, which affects the rights of private parties through
                    either adjudication or rule-making. The very definition of an
                    administrative agency includes its being vested with quasi-judicial
                    powers. The ever increasing variety of powers and functions given to
                    administrative agencies recognizes the need for the active intervention
                    of administrative agencies in matters calling for technical knowledge
                    and speed in countless controversies which cannot possibly be handled by
                    regular courts. The CIAC's primary function is that of a quasi-judicial
                    agency, which is to adjudicate claims and/or determine rights in
                    accordance with procedures set forth in E.O. No. 1008. </p>
                <p> In the second place, the language of Section 1 of Circular No.
                    1-91 emphasizes the obvious inclusion of the CIAC even if it is not
                    named in the enumeration of quasi-judicial agencies. The introductory
                    words "[a]mong these agencies are" preceding the enumeration of specific
                    quasi-judicial agencies only highlight the fact that the list is not
                    exclusive or conclusive. Further, the overture stresses and acknowledges
                    the existence of other quasi-judicial agencies not included in the
                    enumeration but should be deemed included. In addition, the CIAC is
                    obviously excluded in the catalogue of cases not covered by the Circular
                    and mentioned in Section 2 thereof for the reason that at the time the
                    Circular took effect, E.O. No. 1008 allows appeals to the Supreme Court
                    on questions of law. </p>
                <p> In sum, under Circular No. 1-91, appeals from the arbitral
                    awards of the CIAC may be brought to the Court of Appeals, and not to
                    the Supreme Court alone. The grounds for the appeal are likewise
                    broadened to include appeals on questions of facts and appeals involving
                    mixed questions of fact and law. </p>
                <p> The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over appeals from final
                    orders or decisions of the CIAC is further fortified by the amendments
                    to B.P. Blg. 129, as introduced by R.A. No. 7902. With the amendments,
                    the Court of Appeals is vested with appellate jurisdiction over all
                    final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional
                    Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or
                    commissions, except "those within the appellate jurisdiction of the
                    Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the
                    Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the
                    provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph
                    and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the
                    Judiciary Act of 1948." </p>
                <p> . . . .</p>
                <p> Any remaining doubt on the procedural mutation of the provisions
                    on appeal in E.O. No. 1008, vis-a-vis Circular No. 1-91 and R.A. No.
                    7902, was completely removed with the issuance by the Supreme Court of
                    Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95 and the 1997 Rules of Civil
                    Procedure. Both categorically include the CIAC in the enumeration of
                    quasi-judicial agencies comprehended therein. Section 3 of the former
                    and Section 3, Rule 43 of the latter, explicitly expand the issues that
                    may be raised in an appeal from quasi-judicial agencies or
                    instrumentalities to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the
                    manner therein provided. Indisputably, the review of the CIAC award may
                    involve either questions of fact, of law, or of fact and law. </p>
                <p> In view of all the foregoing, we reject MCI's submission that
                    Circular No. 1-91, B.P. Blg. 129, as amended by R.A. 7902, Revised
                    Administrative Circular 1-95, and Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil
                    Procedure failed to efficaciously modify the provision on appeals in
                    E.O. No. 1008. We further discard MCI's claim that these amendments have
                    the effect of merely changing the forum for appeal from the Supreme
                    Court to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>

                <p> It is opportune to repudiate the mistaken notion that appeals on
                    questions of fact of CIAC awards may be coursed through the Court of
                    Appeals. No statute actually vests jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals

                not broaden the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. Neither do the
                amendments introduced to Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 by Republic Act No.
                7902 broaden the Court of Appeals' appellate jurisdiction as to extend

                <p>The Construction Industry Arbitration Law could not have been
                    ignorant of the then Intermediate Appellate Court's appellate
                    jurisdiction. When the Construction Industry Arbitration Law made
                    appeals on questions of law exclusive to this Court, it was with a
                    complete awareness that regular appeals could have otherwise also been
                    made available through the Intermediate Appellate Court. Still, it
                    deliberately elected to make no such appeal available. </p>
                <p> Section 19 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Law
                    calculatedly made Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 9(3)&#8212;a counterpart
                    statutory provision on appellate jurisdiction&#8212;ineffectual to appeals
                    involving factual review of CIAC arbitral awards. </p><p> Republic Act
                No. 7902 did amend Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 9(3). However, its
                amendments added only two statements: first, an enumeration of examples
                of quasi-judicial agencies whose decisions were subject to the Court of
                Appeals' appellate jurisdiction;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
                and second, a reference to the Labor Code in its consideration of the
                exceptions to the Court of Appeals' exclusive appellate jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p>
                Thus, despite Republic Act No. 7902's amendments, Batas Pambansa Blg.
                129, Section 9(3)'s operative clause remained unchanged, that is, that
                the renamed 	Court 	of Appeals would 	exercise "[e]xclusive appellate
                jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or
                awards of . . . quasi-judicial agencies . . . except those falling

                <p>If, in 1985, this operative clause did not sway the Construction
                    Industry Arbitration Law to enable regular factual appeals to the
                    Intermediate Appellate Court, then, neither should its verbatim
                    restatement, in 1995, enable appeals on factual issues to the Court of
                    Appeals. </p>
                <p> With the inefficacy of Republic Act No. 7902, <i>Metro Construction</i>'s
                    proffered "procedural mutation" is left with nothing to rely on except,
                    as its own terminology implies, mere provisions of procedural law:
                    first, Circular No. 1-91; second, Circular No. 1-95; and third, Rule 43,
                    Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. </p><p> Still, these
                are not constitutional or statutory substantive law provisions. Thus,
                they fail to vest appellate jurisdiction over CIAC awards in the Court
                of Appeals. Contrary to what <i>Metro Construction </i>stated, they could not have "broadened"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> appellate jurisdiction over CIAC awards, or "expand[ed] the issues"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (i.e., the subject matter) that may be considered in appeals of CIAC awards. </p><p>
                While there seemed to have been basis for expanding appeals, there has
                also been an apparent basis for totally restricting appeals. </p><p>
                Another seeming basis for concluding that appellate jurisdiction over
                CIAC Awards has been altered is A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC, the Special Rules
                of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution (the Special ADR Rules). Rule
                19.7 of these Rules precludes parties who submit themselves to
                arbitration from questioning arbitral awards, whether by appeal or by
                certiorari:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Rule 19.7. No appeal or certiorari on the merits of an arbitral
                    award. - An agreement to refer a dispute to arbitration shall mean that
                    the arbitral award shall be final and binding. </p>
                <p> Consequently, a party to an arbitration is precluded from filing
                    an appeal or a petition for certiorari questioning the merits of an
                    arbitral award. </p>
            </blockquote>
                <p> The disallowance of appeals under the Special ADR Rules is
                    consistent with the ADR Law. While Section 46 of the ADR Law
                    contemplates appeals subsequent to arbitration proceedings, it pertains
                    only to appeals from regional trial court decisions "confirming,
                    vacating, setting aside, modifying or correcting an arbitral award," not
                    to appeals from an arbitral award itself:
                </p><blockquote>
                <p> SECTION 46. Appeal from Court Decisions on Arbitral Awards. &#8212; A
                    decision of the Regional Trial Court confirming, vacating, setting
                    aside, modifying or correcting an arbitral award may be appealed to the
                    Court of Appeals in accordance with the rules of procedure to be
                    promulgated by the Supreme Court. </p>
                <p> The losing party who appeals from the judgment of the court
                    confirming an arbitral award shall be required by the appellate court to
                    post a counterbond executed in favor of the prevailing party equal to
                    the amount of the award in accordance with the rules to be promulgated
                    by the Supreme Court.</p>
            </blockquote>
                <p><i>Fruehauf Electronics Philippines Corporation v. Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> confirms that appeals are not a remedy against arbitral awards:
                </p><blockquote>
                <p> The errors of an arbitral tribunal are not subject to correction
                    by the judiciary. As a private alternative to court proceedings,
                    arbitration is meant to be an end, not the beginning, of litigation.
                    Thus, the arbitral award is final and binding on the parties by reason
                    of their contract &#8212; the arbitration agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
            </blockquote>
                <p> However, the same <em>Fruehauf</em> Decision has settled that
                    construction arbitration through the quasi-judicial mechanism of the
                    CIAC must be distinguished from general commercial arbitration through
                    contractually established arbitral tribunals. This, even as the ADR
                    Law&#8212;in Chapter 6&#8212;references construction arbitration. <i>Fruehauf</i> clearly states that "as a quasi- judicial body, the CIAC's awards are specifically made appealable to this Court by law[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
                </p><p> Thus, the mechanics of appeals, as originally spelled out by
                the Construction Industry Arbitration Law in 1985, remain unaltered.
                Appeals have not been expanded to possibly be coursed through the Court
                of Appeals, <i>and</i> there raise factual issues, as <i>Metro Construction</i>
                and Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure state. Neither have
                they been restricted or entirely negated, as the Special ADR Rules
                suggest. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b>
            </p><p> <i>CE Construction</i> explained the practical import of Rule
                43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. 	It emphasized that Rule 43 did
                not abandon the exclusiveness of appeals to questions of law:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure standardizes
                    appeals from quasi-judicial agencies. Rule 43, Section 1 explicitly
                    lists the CIAC as among the quasi-judicial agencies covered by Rule 43.
                    Section 3 indicates that appeals through Petitions for Review under Rule
                    43 are to "be taken to the Court of Appeals . . . whether the appeal
                    involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law."
                </p>
                <p> This is not to say that factual findings of CIAC arbitral
                    tribunals may now be assailed before the Court of Appeals. Section 3's
                    statement "whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or
                    mixed questions of fact and law" merely recognizes variances in the
                    disparate modes of appeal that Rule 43 standardizes: there were those
                    that enabled questions of fact; there were those that enabled questions
                    of law, and there were those that enabled mixed questions fact and law.
                    Rule 43 emphasizes that though there may have been variances, all
                    appeals under its scope are to be brought before the Court of Appeals.
                    However, in keeping with the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, any
                    appeal from CIAC arbitral tribunals must remain limited to questions of
                    law. </p>
                <p> <i>Hi-Precision Steel Center, Inc. v. Lim Kim Steel Builders, Inc</i>. explained the wisdom underlying the limitation of appeals to pure questions of law: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> Section 19 makes it crystal clear that questions of fact
                        cannot be raised in proceedings before the Supreme Court &#8212; which is not a
                        trier of facts &#8212; in respect of an arbitral award rendered under the
                        aegis of the CIAC. Consideration of the animating "purpose of voluntary
                        arbitration in general, and arbitration under the aegis of the CIAC in
                        particular, requires us to apply rigorously the above principle embodied
                        in Section 19 that the Arbitral Tribunal's findings of fact shall be
                        final and unappealable. </p>
                    <p> Voluntary arbitration involves the reference of a dispute to
                        an impartial body, the members of which are chosen by the parties
                        themselves, which parties freely consent in advance to abide by the
                        arbitral award issued after proceedings where both parties had the
                        opportunity to be heard. The basic objective is to provide a speedy and
                        inexpensive method of settling disputes by allowing the parties to avoid
                        the formalities, delay, expense and aggravation which commonly
                        accompany ordinary litigation, especially litigation which goes through
                        the entire hierarchy of courts. [The Construction Industry Arbitration
                        Law] created an arbitration facility to which the construction industry
                        in the Philippines can have recourse. The [Construction Industry
                        Arbitration Law] was enacted to encourage the early and expeditious
                        settlement of disputes in the construction industry, a public policy the
                        implementation of which is necessary and important for the realization
                        of national development goals. </p>

                <p> Consistent with this restrictive approach, this Court is
                    duty-bound to be extremely watchful and to ensure that an appeal does
                    not become an ingenious means for undermining the integrity of
                    arbitration or for conveniently setting aside the conclusions that
                    arbitral processes make. Appeals are not an artifice for the parties to
                    undermine the process they voluntarily elected to engage in. To prevent
                    this Court from being a party to such perversion, this Court's
                    primordial inclination must be to uphold the factual findings of
                    arbitral tribunals: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor
                        field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that
                        matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties
                        in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private
                        purposes. <i>The Court will not review the factual findings of an
                            arbitral tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had
                            "misapprehended the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at
                            bottom, issues of fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be
                            as "legal questions."</i> The parties here had recourse to arbitration
                        and chose the arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in
                        such arbitrators. 	<i>The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties
                            to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and
                            argued before the Arbitral Tribunal</i>, save only where a very clear
                        snowing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral
                        Tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to
                        constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of
                        jurisdiction. Prototypical examples would be factual conclusions of the
                        Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the other party of a
                        fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal,
                        and an award 	obtained 	through 	fraud 	or 	the 		corruption 	of
                        arbitrators. <i>Any other more relaxed, rule would result in setting at
                            naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration and would reduce
                            arbitration to a largely inutile institution</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</p>

                exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions. Rule 65 is a means of

                of judicial power "to determine whether or not there has been a grave

                CIAC exists within the larger, general framework of arbitration put in
                place, initially by Republic Act No. 876 (the ADR Law), and eventually
                by Republic Act No. 9285 (the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of

                    very narrow grounds that go into the integrity of the CIAC arbitral
                    tribunal, and, in addition, outright violations of the Constitution or
                    laws. </p><p> To be clear, this calibrated understanding of grave abuse
                of discretion in the specific context of review via certiorari of CIAC
                arbitral tribunal awards <i>does not</i> undermine the integrity of the
                remedy of certiorari. The remedial vehicle of a petition for certiorari
                under Rule 65 was created by this Court pursuant, in particular, to its
                rule-making power under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the 1987
                Constitution. This power to "[p]romulgate rules concerning. . .
                pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts" proceeds from judicial
                power in general. </p><p> Judicial power pertains to our capacity to
                authoritatively read and interpret laws. Rule 65, then, is an expression
                of this Court's interpretative authority, one that is applicable to
                general circumstances involving grave abuse of discretion. In
                appropriate situations, such an expression may be refined or adjusted,
                given this Court's peculiar appreciation of facts and laws. This
                calibration of grave abuse of discretion and the availability of
                certiorari vis-a-vis CIAC arbitral awards (which I join the ponencia in
                advancing) is one such situation of a proper refinement or adjustment of
                how a procedural rule, i.e., Rule 65, previously laid out by this Court
                should apply.</p><p> Beyond the narrow grounds for review on certiorari
                (i.e., grounds that go into the integrity of the CIAC arbitral
                tribunal, or outright violations of the Constitution or laws), rulings
                of the CIAC may be reviewed only by this Court on purely legal questions
                raised through petitions for review on certiorari. As the<i> ponencia </i>explains:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> A harmonization of these conflicting rules leaves the Court with
                    the conclusion that the inclusion of CIAC under Rule 43 appeals is
                    without footing in the legal history of CIAC, and therefore must be
                    unequivocally reversed. </p>
                <p> More specifically, the Court holds that the direct recourse of
                    an appeal of a CIAC award on questions of law directly to this Court is
                    the rule, pursuant to E.O 1008 and R.A. 9285, notwithstanding Rule 43 on
                    CA's jurisdiction over quasi-judicial agencies, and Rule 45 in its
                    exclusive application to lower courts. Thus, an appeal from an arbitral
                    award of CIAC may take either of two tracks, as determined by the
                    subject matter of the challenge. </p>
                <p> On the one hand, if the parties seek to challenge a finding of
                    law of the tribunal, then the same may be appealed only to the Supreme
                    Court under Rule 45. To determine whether or not a question is one of
                    law which may be brought before the Court under Rule 45, it is useful to
                    recall that a question of a question of law involves a doubt or
                    controversy as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, as
                    opposed to a question of fact which involves a doubt or difference that
                    arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts, or when the query
                    necessarily calls for a review and reevaluation of the whole evidence,
                    including the credibility of witnesses, existence of specific
                    surrounding circumstances, and the decided probabilities of the
                    situation. The test here is not the party's characterization of the
                    question before the court, but whether the court may resolve the issue
                    brought to it by solely inquiring as to whether the law was properly
                    applied and without going into a review of the evidence. </p>
                <p> On the other hand, if the parties seek to challenge CIAC's
                    finding of fact, the same may only be allowed under either of two
                    premises, namely assailing the very integrity of the composition of the
                    tribunal, or alleging the arbitral tribunal's violation of the
                    Constitution or positive law, in which cases the appeal may be filed
                    before the CA on these limited grounds through the special civil action
                    of a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, in accordance with Section 4
                    in relation to Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure: </p>
                <p> . . . .</p>
                <p> The resort to Rule 65, instead of Rule 43, further finds support
                    in the very nature of the factual circumstances which trigger said
                    exceptional factual review &#8211; those that center not on the actual
                    findings of fact but on the integrity of the tribunal that makes these
                    findings, or their compliance with the Constitution or positive law,
                    i.e., any of the following factual allegations: (1) the award was
                    procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was
                    evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them;
                    (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear
                    evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of
                    the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under  Section nine of
                    Republic Act No. 876 or the Arbitration Law (R.A. 876), and willfully
                    refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other
                    misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially
                    prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so
                    imperfectly executed them, that a mutual , final and definite award upon
                    the subject matter submitted to them was not made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p>
            </blockquote>
                <p> The approach outlined by the<em> ponencia</em> is consistent with
                    the primacy accorded to arbitral awards, fundamentally, because of
                    arbitration's nature as a dispute resolution mechanism animated by the
                    parties' free and voluntary intent to engage an arbitrator's expertise
                    free from the rigidities of the conventional court system. "Arbitration
                    is a creature of contract[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> devised precisely to be free of the restraints of litigating in court. This makes it both economically efficient and equitable.</p><p>
                As a creature of contract, arbitration internalizes and limits the cost
                of dispute resolution between the parties. It is equitable in that, it
                will free the dockets of courts (which, through taxpayers money is a
                subsidized means of dispute resolution) enabling them to devote more
                time, energy, and resources to those conflicts with a more pronounced
                public interest, such as those where power relations suffer from a
                greater deficit (e.g., rape and sexual abuse, labor disputes, cases
                raising questions of social justice, and skewed commercial relations
                such as consumer grievances), public interest cases (such as those
                raising constitutional issues), and matters of social order (e.g.,
                criminal cases). </p><p> The understanding of arbitration as a creature
                of contract facilitating the parties' realization of their private ends
                has particularly ripened in international commercial arbitration:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p> In international law, the basic theory of arbitration is simple
                    and rather elegant. Arbitral jurisdiction is entirely consensual. As in
                    Roman law and the systems influenced by it, arbitration is a creature of
                    contract. The arbitrator's powers are derived from the parties'
                    contract. Hence, in the classic sense, an arbitrator is not entitled to
                    do anything unauthorized by the parties: <i>arbiter nihil extra compromissum facere potest</i>.
                    An arbitral award rendered within the framework of the common agreement
                    of the parties is itself part of the contract and hence binding on
                    them. Conversely, a purported award which is accomplished in ways
                    inconsistent with the shared contractual expectations of the parties is
                    something to which they had not agreed. The arbitrator has exceeded his
                    power or, to use the technical term, committed an <i>exces de pouvoir</i>. If the allegation of such an excess can be sustained, the putative award is null, and may be ignored by the "losing" party. </p>
                <p> Arbitration is advantageous to parties because it gives them an
                    additional contractual option for resolving disputes without engaging
                    community structures. It is also advantageous to the community: it
                    allows economical resolution of private disputes that are often
                    diversions from productive activity, without more general disruption and
                    without direct cost to the community. The doctrine of <i>exces de pouvoir</i>
                    functions as an indispensable control mechanism in this scheme. Without
                    it, arbitration would lose its character of restrictive delegation and
                    the arbitrator would become a decision maker with virtually absolute
                    discretion; whatever limits may have been prescribed by the parties
                    would become meaningless because the arbitrator would be answerable
                    effectively to no one.<i> Exces de pouvoir </i>thus is the conceptual foundation of control for arbitration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
            </blockquote>
                <p> Another author keenly discussed the particular utility of
                    arbitration in commercial relationships. His discussion also explored
                    how the "contractarian model" animated the United States' Federal
                    Arbitration Act's pioneering delineation of the distinctly restrictive
                    grounds for vacating arbitral awards. Quite notably, our own pioneering
                    Arbitral Law, Republic Act No. 876, would adopt in its Section 24
                    precisely the same restrictive grounds spelled out by the Federal
                    Arbitration Act:
                </p><blockquote>
                <p> The contractarian model made sense when applied to commercial
                    relationships because the merchants who employed it typically subscribed
                    to a common set of business practices. When they had disputes, they
                    wanted neutrals grounded in those practices to make decisions based on
                    custom and mutual interest They did not want anyone, whether a genuine
                    judge or a minor league one, to mechanically apply fixed legal rules. </p>
                <p> With [Julius Henry] Cohen as its champion, the American Bar
                    Association's Committee on Commerce, Trade, and Commercial Law succeeded
                    in pushing the [Federal Arbitration Act) through Congress. The [Federal
                    Arbitration Act] ... seems clearly to assume a role for the arbitrator
                    consistent with the contractarian model. That perspective comes through
                    in the provisions for judicial review of awards. Section 10 of the
                    [Federal Arbitration Act] contains a list of four grounds for vacating
                    arbitral awards: </p>

                <p>It would be regressive, both for contracting parties in arbitration
                    and to society in general, for this Court to insist on expansive
                    judicial review of arbitral awards. Unduly expansive judicial review
                    undermines an otherwise effective, self-contained mechanism for dispute
                    resolution. Any form of conflict resolution will see the losing party
                    dissatisfied. Yet it must, at some point, have a definite ending. <i>Interest rei publicae ut sit finis litium</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>
                    The further continuation of otherwise settled conflicts, particularly
                    for those which are distinctly private in character, must be pursued
                    only when there are compelling, ineluctable grounds. </p>
                <p> When a private conflict may otherwise be put to rest by the
                    mechanism specifically devised by the parties for it, it is a disservice
                    to the larger community to compel a court to have that conflict be an
                    exclusionary object of its attention. This is what it means to not
                    disturb arbitral awards, lest the integrity of the arbitral tribunal
                    itself be compromised. As, when an arbitral tribunal is wanting in
                    integrity, what are committed are not mere mistakes by erstwhile
                    experts, but a definite offense against fairness and truth; there is
                    then a miscarriage of justice.
                </p><p> Ultimately, the<i> ponencia </i>is correct in concluding that
                the "[Court of Appeals] misapplied its appellate function when it delved

                <p> <strong><br>LAZARO-JAVIER, <em>J</em>.:</strong><br></p><div align="justify">Essentially, the <i>Majority</i> would like to give true force and
                effect to the legislature's express intent on how and under what
                grounds the review of domestic arbitral awards should be
                operationalized. The <i>Majority</i> pushes for Rule 45, instead of Rule 43, as the prescribed mode of review for construction arbitration cases. In so doing, the <i>Ponencia</i> rejects the following:
                <blockquote>
                    <p> <b><i>First</i></b>, the present iteration of Rule 43 stating
                        that a petition for review "shall apply to appeals from awards,
                        judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any
                        quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions.
                        Among these agencies (is) the ... Construction Industry Arbitration
                        Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
                    <p> <b><em>Second</em></b>, the consistent and long-standing
                        recognition by the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, the
                        litigants, and even by this Court that it is the Court of Appeals, no
                        other, which has appellate jurisdiction over CIAC's dispositions
                        (through its panel of arbitrators) in construction arbitration cases
                        ever since Republic Act No. (RA) 7902<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> took effect in 1995.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
                    <p> <b><i>Third</i></b>, all our decisions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
                        under Rule 45 where we took cognizance of and resolved petitions
                        emanating from the Rule 43 appellate dispositions of the Court of
                        Appeals in CIAC cases brought before it. We ourselves have never before
                        impugned such vesture of jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals. Far from
                        it, we have, for the longest time, explicitly and consistently
                        recognized this jurisdiction <i>via</i> our present iteration of Rule 43. </p>
                    <p> <b><i>Fourth</i></b>, the CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which took effect on December 15, 2005. Section 18<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
                        of the rules similarly echoes the vesture of appellate jurisdiction in
                        the Court of Appeals over construction arbitration cases <i>via</i> Rule
                        43. CIAC is the agency tasked by law to implement the CIAC Law, hence,
                        its interpretation of the law, as borne in the rules, deserves the
                        Court's highest respect. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p> With due respect, however, the Majority appears to have <b>conflated</b> the <b><i>vacatur</i></b> and the <b><i>modification or correction</i></b> mechanisms in RA 876<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and RA 9285<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and the <i>Revised CIAC Rules</i> with the <b><i>appeal</i></b> process also provided for and delineated in the same laws. If the Court should abide by legislative intent, there is <i>nothing clearer and more explicit</i> than the <b>distinctions</b> between the <b><i>vacatur</i></b> and the <b><i>modification or correction</i></b> mechanisms and the<b><i> appeal</i></b> process in the relevant statutes and implementing rules themselves. </p><p> The <b><i>vacatur</i></b> and <b>correction mechanisms</b> referred by the<i> Majority</i>, <b>including </b>the allegedly <b>exclusive grounds to be invoked</b> for the <b>same</b>, all refer to the <b>proceedings</b> at the <b>Regional Trial Court</b> and <b>not the appeal/review proceedings</b> at the <b>Court of Appeals</b>. It is therefore a <b>leap in logic to restrict</b> the appeal/review proceedings in the Court of Appeals <b>solely</b> to the grounds for vacating or correcting an arbitral award by a Regional Trial Court. </p><p> The <b>"integrity-centered" grounds</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> referred to by the <i>Majority</i> <b>does not pertain to the appeal/review of the Court of Appeals</b> but to the <b>vacatur</b> and <b>modification</b> proceedings before the Regional Trial Court. <b>On one hand</b>, RA 876<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> allows the Court of Appeals to entertain <b>questions of law</b> in the appeal/review; on the other, RA 9285<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> is open-ended as regards the questions that may be raised in the appeal/review process. </p><p> <b>To be sure</b>, under both RA 876 and RA 9285, an appeal to the Court of Appeals is <b>from an order or decision</b> rendered by the <b>Regional Trial Court</b> in <strong>confirming</strong>, vacating, or correcting an arbitral award or otherwise. The appeal/review of the Court of Appeals is<strong> not</strong> from the arbitral award itself. This should <strong>thus explain</strong> Rule 19.7<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the <em><strong>Special ADR Rules</strong></em> that "[c]onsequently, a party to an arbitration is <strong>precluded</strong> from<strong> filing</strong> an appeal or a <strong>petition for <em>certiorari</em> questioning</strong> the merits of an <strong>arbitral award</strong>."
                </p><p> <strong>However</strong>, Section 40 of RA 9285<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> provides that "[a] <strong>CIAC arbitral award need not be confirmed by the Regional Trial Court</strong> to be executory as provided under E.O. No. 1008." Hence, there <strong>will be no order or decision</strong> from the <strong>Regional Trial Court</strong> that may be <strong>appealed to</strong> or <strong>reviewed by the Court of Appeals</strong>,<em> unless</em> one of the parties <em>moved to vacate or correct</em> a<strong> CIAC</strong> arbitral award before the Regional Trial Court.
                </p><p> Notably, a <strong>CIAC </strong>arbitral award itself is <strong>NOT immune from appeal/review</strong> by the Court of Appeals. A party to an arbitration DOES NOT also have to <strong>first</strong> seek to vacate or correct the arbitral award <strong>before</strong> it may be appealed to and reviewed by the Court of Appeals.
                </p><p> The <em>Majority</em> nonetheless posits that RA 9285 has re-enacted the appeal procedure under the <strong>original version</strong> of Section 19 of Executive Order No. (EO) 1008<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> so that the appeal is<strong> now back</strong>
                    to this Court from the Court of Appeals on questions of law and the
                    appeal procedure will already be under Rule 45, Rules of Court, by<em> certiorari</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
                </p><p> Section 19<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of EO
                    1008 (circa 1985), however, cannot be deemed to have been reenacted
                    into RA 9285 (circa 2004). Section 19 states that the arbitral award
                    shall be final and inappealable except on questions of law which shall
                    be brought to the Supreme Court. </p><p> While it is true that Section
                    34 of RA 9285 states that the arbitration of construction disputes shall
                    be governed by EO 1008, this refers only to the <strong>arbitration proceedings proper before the CIAC, not thereafter</strong>.
                    This is clear from the entirety of CHAPTER 6 entitled ARBITRATION OF
                    CONSTRUCTION DISPUTES of RA 9285 which includes Sections 34 to 39, <i>viz</i>.:

                    <p> <strong>SECTION 34.</strong> <em>Arbitration of Construction Disputes: Governing Law</em>.
                        &#8211; The arbitration of construction disputes shall be governed by
                        Executive Order No. 1008, otherwise known as the Construction Industry
                        Arbitration Law. </p>
                    <p> <strong>SECTION 35.</strong> <em>Coverage of the Law</em>. &#8211;
                        Construction disputes which fall within the original and exclusive
                        jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (the
                        "Commission") shall include those between or among parties to, or who
                        are otherwise bound by, an arbitration agreement, directly or by
                        reference whether such parties are project owner, contractor,
                        subcontractor, fabricator, project manager, design professional,
                        consultant, quantity surveyor, bondsman or issuer of an insurance policy
                        in a construction project. </p>
                    <p> The Commission shall continue to exercise original and exclusive
                        jurisdiction over construction disputes although the arbitration is
                        "commercial" pursuant to Section 21 of this Act. </p>
                    <p> <strong>SECTION 36. </strong><em>Authority to Act as Mediator or Arbitrator</em>.
                        &#8211; By written agreement of the parties to a dispute, an arbitrator may
                        act as mediator and a mediator may act as arbitrator. The parties may
                        also agree in writing that, following a successful mediation, the
                        mediator shall issue the settlement agreement in the form of an arbitral
                        award. </p>
                    <p> <strong>SECTION 37. </strong><em>Appointment of Foreign Arbitrator</em>.
                        &#8211; The Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) shall
                        promulgate rules to allow for the appointment of a foreign arbitrator as
                        co-arbitrator or chairman of a tribunal a person who has not been
                        previously accredited by CIAC: Provided, That: </p>
                    <p> (a) the dispute is a construction dispute in which one party is an international party; </p>
                    <p> (b) the person to be appointed agreed to abide by the arbitration rules and policies of CIAC; </p>
                    <p> (c) he/she is either co-arbitrator upon the nomination of the
                        international party; or he/she is the common  choice of the two
                        CIAC-accredited arbitrators first appointed, one "of whom was nominated
                        by the international party; and</p>
                    <p> (d) the foreign arbitrator shall be of different nationality from the international party. </p>
                    <p> <strong>SECTION 38. </strong><em>Applicability to Construction Arbitration</em>.
                        &#8211; The provisions of Section 17(d) of Chapter 2, and Sections 28 and 29
                        of this Act shall apply to arbitration of construction disputes covered
                        by this Chapter. </p>
                    <p> <strong>SECTION 39.</strong> <em>Court to Dismiss Case Involving a Construction Dispute</em>.
                        &#8211; A Regional Trial Court before which a construction dispute is filed
                        shall, upon becoming aware, not later than the pre-trial conference,
                        that the parties had entered into an arbitration agreement, dismiss the
                        case and refer the parties to arbitration to be conducted by the CIAC,
                        unless both parties, assisted by their respective counsel, shall submit
                        to the Regional Trial Court a written agreement exclusively for the
                        Court, rather than the CIAC, to resolve the dispute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The fact that Section 34 is grouped together with the provisions
                    governing the construction disputes within the jurisdiction of CIAC, the
                    manner by which the parties may choose the arbitrator or mediator who
                    will resolve their dispute, the requisites for appointment of foreign
                    arbitrator, the adoption of certain provisions of RA 9285, specifically
                    Section 17,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Chapter 2 on the enforcement of mediated settlement agreement and Sections 28<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and 29,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Chapter 3 on the grant of interim measure of protection pending arbitration before the CIAC, means that Section 34<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
                    in fact refers only to the adoption of EO 1008 governing the
                    arbitration proceedings before the CIAC and not thereafter when judicial
                    remedies already come into play.
                </p><p> Indeed, after an award or judgment is rendered at the CIAC
                    level, the arbitration process should be deemed to have ended too. Thus,
                    when this award or judgment, <em>etc.</em> is challenged in court, the adversarial judicial process begins, not <em>via</em> Rule 45 as supposedly prescribed by Section 19 of EO 1008, but<em> via</em>
                    Rule 43 and before the Court of Appeals as validly decreed under RA
                    7902 which is deemed to have long amended Section 19 of EO 1008.
                </p><p> Admittedly, we have the Special Rules of Court on Alternative
                    Dispute Resolution, Rule 19.7 which read: "&#8230; a party to an arbitration
                    is precluded from filing an appeal or a petition for <em>certiorari</em>
                    questioning the merits of an arbitral tribunal." But these rules should
                    not be construed to repeal a statute enacted by Congress, such as RA
                    7902, which the Court is conclusively presumed to have known of when it
                    promulgated these Special Rules. Notably, even after the promulgation of
                    the Special Rules in 2009, we did not amend Rule 43. In fact, even in
                    2019 when we revised our Rules on Civil Procedure, we did not amend Rule
                    43 insofar as CIAC cases are concerned. We simply continued to
                    recognize the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over the dispositions
                    of CIAC<em> via</em> Rule 43 pursuant to RA 7902. If at all, Rule 19.7
                    should be construed as applying only to the process of alternative
                    dispute resolution before arbitration tribunals other than CIAC which is
                    already specifically governed by Rule 43.
                </p><p> In any event, if the <em>Majority</em> is correct, that Rule 19.7 should be understood to be absolute and literal, then even the prescribed remedy by the <em>Ponencia</em>, a Rule 45 petition to this Court, would also have been prohibited.
                </p><p> More important, RA 9285 took effect in 2004, hence, it is governed by the 1987 Constitution. Section 30, Art. VI<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
                    of the 1987 Constitution provides that "no law shall be passed
                    increasing the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided
                    in this Constitution without its advice and consent." On the basis of
                    this provision, therefore, the alleged vesture under the so-called
                    reenacted Section 19 of EO 1008 of "exclusive appellate jurisdiction in
                    the Supreme Court" over CIAC awards, judgments, etc., without its advice
                    and consent, is <strong>unconstitutional</strong>. This must be the
                    reason why despite the effectivity of EO 1008 and its so-called
                    reenactment into RA 9285, the iteration of Rule 43 since 1997 remains
                    the same to this very date, that is, the jurisdiction of the Court of
                    Appeals over CIAC awards, <em>etc.</em> remains vested in the Court of Appeals<em> via</em> a petition for review. Clearly, in promulgating Rule 43, the Supreme Court has applied RA 7902,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and never Section 19 of EO 1008 whether in its original text or as purportedly reenacted.
                </p><p> Further, note the specific provisions in Chapter 7 of RA 9285 on <b><i><u>judicial review</u></i></b>. If the intention of Section 34 <em>were</em> to adopt <em><strong>in toto</strong></em> EO 1008 (specifically Section 19) and not only the provisions with respect to the <b><i><u>voluntary</u></i></b> dispute resolution of <b><i>arbitration</i></b>, RA 9285 <em>would not have</em> enacted Chapter 7 and <em>would not have</em> provided specific provisions on <b><i>judicial review</i></b> by the Regional Trial Court, <em>viz</em>.:
                </p><blockquote>
                    <p> A. DOMESTIC AWARDS</p>
                    <p> <b>SECTION 40.</b><i> Confirmation of Award</i>. &#8212; The confirmation of a domestic arbitral award shall be governed by Section 23 of R.A. No. 876. </p>
                    <p> A domestic arbitral award when confirmed shall be enforced in
                        the same manner as final and executory decisions of the Regional Trial
                        Court. </p>
                    <p> The recognition and enforcement of an award in an international
                        commercial arbitration shall be governed by Article 35 of the Model Law.

                </blockquote>
                <p> Too, if Section 34 of RA 9285 <em>were all encompassing</em>, there <strong>would have been no need for Congress</strong> to enact the last paragraph of Section 40 of RA 9285, <em>viz</em>.:
                </p><blockquote>
                    <p> The confirmation of a domestic award shall be made by the
                        Regional Trial Court in accordance with the Rules of Procedure to be
                        promulgated by the Supreme Court. </p>
                    <p> A CIAC arbitral award need not be confirmed by the Regional Trial Court to be executory as provided under E.O. No. 1008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p> Further,<strong> note that </strong>Section 40 is actually a <b><i><u>mere reiteration</u></i></b> of Section 20 of EO 1008, <em>viz</em>.:
                </p><blockquote>
                    <p> <strong>SECTION 20.</strong> <em>Execution and Enforcement of Awards</em>.

                        a writ of execution requiring any sheriff or other proper officer to
                        execute said decision, order or award.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p> <strong>Yet</strong>, Congress <b><i><u>still included</u></i></b>
                    this portion of Section 40 in RA 9285. This shows even more that the
                    adoption of EO 1008 into RA 9285 applies only to the provisions
                    pertaining to the arbitration proceeding proper before the CIAC and does
                    not include the adoption of the provisions on judicial remedies.
                </p><p> If truly the intent of Section 34 were truly what the <em>Majority</em> asserts it to be, Section 40 would have been an <strong>unnecessary provision</strong>. But Congress <strong>could not have</strong> enacted a <strong>useless provision</strong>. The fact that the last paragraph of Section 40 was enacted <strong>only means</strong> that Section 34 is <strong>not all encompassing</strong> as the <em>Ponencia</em> says it is.
                </p><p> I cannot subscribe to the position of the <em>Majority</em>
                    that since Section 19 of EO 1008 originally took effect in 1985 under
                    the 1973 Constitution where advice and consent of the Supreme Court was
                    not yet required,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> its reenactment into RA 9285, <em>albeit</em>
                    the same took effect under the new Constitution, remains exempt from
                    complying with the consent and advice requirement. Surely, every
                    provision of law even that which has been simply reenacted, is, in the
                    eyes of the Constitution, a new provision altogether. As such, it must
                    comply with the requirements of the Constitution effective at the time
                    it is passed and becomes effective. It is absurd to say that most of the
                    provisions of RA 9285 are governed by the 1987 Constitution while one
                    stand out provision remains governed by the 1973 Constitution.
                </p><p> At any rate, in promulgating every single provision in the
                    Rules of Court, the Highest Court of the land is conclusively presumed
                    to know all the relevant existing laws and it will never promulgate
                    rules contrary thereto. To repeat, the claim that the appeal
                    jurisdiction over CIAC arbitral awards has reverted back to the Supreme
                    Court pursuant to Section 34 of RA 9285, specifically pertaining to
                    Section 19 of EO 1008, has no legal basis, nay, unconstitutional. The
                    appellate jurisdiction over CIAC arbitral awards is still with the Court
                    of Appeals and the appellate procedure for this purpose is still under
                    Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. </p><p> As for the grounds upon which the
                    appeal to the Court of Appeals is made, the same cannot be restricted
                    to the grounds impacting on the arbitral tribunal's integrity. RA 7902
                    provides questions of law as the ground for appeal. These are not
                    limited to issues about the integrity of the arbitral tribunal.
                    Questions of law include whether on the basis of the facts on record,
                    the standard of proof has been satisfied. They assume the credibility
                    and reliability of the factual findings of the arbitral tribunal but
                    ask: <i>Did the claimant prove its case according to the standard of proof demanded by the case?</i> </p><p>
                    Going now to Rule 65, the same is always available where there is grave
                    abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction and
                    there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, or adequate remedy available in
                    the ordinary course of law. But even though appeal may be available,
                    Rule 65 may still be resorted to if appeal is not a plain speedy or
                    adequate remedy to the aggrieved party under the circumstances. There is
                    no question that Rule 65 is the appropriate remedy where the CIAC acted
                    with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to excess or lack of
                    jurisdiction. I agree with Senior Associate Justice Estela
                    Perlas-Bernabe that this ground cannot be altered or narrowed down by
                    the Court into just:
                </p><blockquote>
                    <p> The resort to Rule 65, instead of Rule 43, further finds support
                        in the very nature of the factual circumstances which trigger said
                        exceptional factual review&#8212;those that center not on the actual findings
                        of fact but on the integrity of the tribunal that makes these findings,
                        or their compliance with the Constitution or positive law,<em> i.e.</em>,
                        any of the following factual allegations: (1) the award was procured by
                        corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident
                        partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the
                        arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence
                        pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the
                        arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under Section 9 of R.A.
                        876, and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or

                </blockquote>
                <p> This is discriminatory, hence, <strong>violative of the equal protection clause</strong>.
                </p><p> In any case, the Court cannot rule that Rule 65, and
                    exclusively on such limited grounds, is the only remedy available at the
                    Court of Appeals. To emphasize, this pronouncement is contrary to RA
                    7902 which defines the remedy as an appeal and the ground as questions
                    of law. In the exercise of its rule making power, the Court had, over
                    two (2) decades ago, identified the procedure of this appeal as falling
                    under Rule 43. This  determination by the 	t is of course correct. The
                    remedy cannot be under Rule 65 because it is not an appeal procedure. </p><p> Finally, because the <em>Majority</em>
                    pushes for the abandonment of our nearly 24-year-old Rule 43 and the
                    countless cases we resolved upholding it, there is also the consequent
                    abandonment of the present CIAC Rules, <strong><em>albeit</em> CIAC is not before us and has not been heard</strong>. Most of all, the issue whether we should revise Rule 43 and, thus, prescribe a new mode of review is being <em>motu proprio</em>
                    advocated, in violation of the Court's strict procedure in revising the
                    provisions of the Rules of Court. Included in this procedure are the
                    creation of a corresponding sub-committee to undertake the study of the
                    proposed amendment and the invitation to the stakeholders to participate
                    and be heard in the process, among others. The amendment of Rule 43,
                    with all its serious repercussions, cannot be done hastily here and now,
                    nay, sharply departing from our prescribed rules on amendments. More so
                    because the appeal or review procedure we now seek to overhaul is not
                    even the subject of the present cases before us now. Thus, the parties
                    are absolutely unaware of this issue and consequently have not been
                    heard thereon.
                </p><p> Lastly, I respectfully <strong>stress</strong> the Court's efforts to <strong>empower</strong> our lower courts, especially the third level appellate courts, by <strong>decentralizing</strong> the appeal/review process and <strong>entrusting</strong> them with<strong> greater</strong> than the usual <strong>adjudicative jurisdiction</strong> and <strong>responsibility for the decisions</strong> they make. This advocacy<strong> has also helped</strong> the Court to <strong>focus</strong> its attention to some extent only to <strong>cases of transcendental importance and impact</strong>. I respectfully submit that the <em>Majority</em> goes <strong>against</strong> this tide of <strong>adjudicative empowerment</strong> and <strong>proper case focus and management</strong>. Allowing the Court of Appeals to take cognizance of the appeal/review from a CIAC Decision <strong>under Rule 43</strong> as there is <strong>no other procedure</strong>, is more in keeping with the time-honored rule that the <strong>transfer of appeals by the Court to subordinate appellate courts is purely a procedural and not a substantive power</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
                </p><p> When the Court resolves to transfer an appeal to a lower court, it only has in mind <strong>practicality</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong>. Procedural amendments are always aimed to <strong>upgrade the Court's efficiency</strong> by <strong>maxing up the Court of Appeals' capability</strong> before they finally reach the Court. It is actually a <strong>filtering mechanism</strong> adopted by the Court so that by the time a case reaches the Court, the <strong>relevant issues</strong>
                    have already been laid straight and the Court can now be true to its
                    mandate of resolving only issues of transcendental importance and
                    impact. Again, this is to enable the Court to devote its precious time
                    and effort to cases with more pressing issues.
                </p><p> Here, there are <strong>no strong</strong> and<strong> justifiable reasons</strong> to <strong>overhaul</strong> jurisprudence that upholds the<strong> jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals </strong>over appeals/review from <strong>CIAC arbitral awards</strong> and to <strong>reject Rule 43 of the <em>Rules of Court</em></strong> as the <strong>governing procedure</strong> for this purpose. Maintaining the <em><strong>status quo </strong></em>would <strong>acknowledge</strong> not only the<strong> competence and expertise of arbitrators</strong> and the <strong>generally
                    final nature of their orders and decisions but also the importance to
                    us of ensuring ample protection for the rights of the parties</strong>.
                </p><p> On the <strong>merits</strong>, I <strong>humbly agree</strong> with the <em>Majority</em> that the Court of Appeals erred in awarding RSII the amount of Php1,088,214.83. The decision of the arbitrators<strong> denying RSII</strong> any claim under Progress Billing No. 15 is <strong>based on substantial evidence</strong>. Hence, the Court of Appeals<strong> erred</strong>
                    in modifying the arbitrators' decision on this aspect. GMCLI should
                    furnish RSII with the pertinent BIR Form 2307. This is pursuant to a<strong> straightforward application</strong>
                    of Section 2.57.3 of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98. As applied here, this
                    Revenue Regulation should have already called for GMCLI to remit the 2%
                    CWT as soon as each Progress Billing was paid and to issue the
                    corresponding BIR Form 2307 to RSII in order for the latter to have had a
                    tax credit claim on the same. </p><p> <b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <strong>PARTIALLY REVERSE</strong>
                    the Decision dated October 28, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
                    SP No. 145753 with respect to the entitlement of RSII to the amount of
                    P1,088,214.83, and to <strong>REINSTATE with MODIFICATION</strong>, the Arbitrators' Decision dated May 10, 2016. GMCLI should be <strong>ORDERED</strong> to furnish RSII with BIR Form 2307. </p><p> However,<b>
                    I maintain my position that the appellate jurisdiction over CIAC
                    arbitral awards is still with the Court of Appeals and the appellate
                    procedure for this purpose is still under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<br><br></b> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT">
