present in the Philippines who is not a mere transient or sojourner is a
resident of the Philippines for purposes of the income tax. Whether he is a
transient or not is determined by his intentions with regard to the length and

to another country is not sufficient to constitute him a transient. If he lives
in the Philippines and has no definite intention as to his stay, he is a
resident. One who comes to the Philippines for a definite purpose which in its
nature may be promptly accomplished is a transient. But if his purpose is of
such a nature that an extended stay may be necessary for its accomplishment,

applies. If, moreover, through force of circumstances a parent is obliged to
maintain his dependent children with relatives or in a boarding house while he
lives elsewhere, the additional exemption may still apply. If, however, without
necessity, the dependent continuously makes his home elsewhere, his benefactor
is not the head of a family, irrespective of the question of support. A

head of a family. Chief support means principal or main support. Partial

Taxation of corporation formed or utilized for avoidance of tax.   Section 25
imposes for each year, in addition to the tax imposed by Section 24 a tax of 25
per cent on the undistributed portion of the profits or surplus of a
corporation which is formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing the
imposition of the tax upon its shareholders or members or the shareholders or
members of any other corporation through the medium of permitting gains or
profits to accumulate instead of dividing or distributing them. However, banks,
insurance companies, personal holding companies and foreign personal holding
companies as defined in Chapter VIII, are excepted from taxation under Section
25. The tax imposed by Section 25 applies whether the avoidance was
accomplished through the formation or use of only one corporation or a chain of
corporations. For example, if the capital stock of the M Corporation is held by
the N Corporation so that the dividend distributions of the M Corporation would
not be returned as income subject to the tax on individuals until distributed

existence or non-existence of the purpose may be indicated by circumstances
other than the evidence specified in Section 25(b), and whether or not such
purpose was present depends upon the particular circumstances of each case. In
other words, a corporation is subject to taxation under Section 25 if it is
formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of the
progressive rates of tax upon shareholders through the medium of permitting
earnings or profits to accumulate, even though the corporation is not a mere
holding or investment company 50 per cent or more of the outstanding stock of
which is owned directly or indirectly by one person, and does not have an
unreasonable accumulation of earnings or profits; and on the other hand, the
fact that a corporation is such a company or has an accumulation is not
absolutely conclusive against it if, by clear and convincing evidence, the
taxpayer satisfies the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that the corporation
was neither formed nor availed of for the purpose of avoiding the tax on
individuals. All the other circumstances which might be construed as evidence
of the purpose to avoid the tax on shareholders cannot be outlined, but among
other things the following will be considered: (1) Dealings between the
corporation and its shareholders, such as withdrawal by the shareholders as
personal loans or the expenditure of funds by corporation for the personal
benefit of the shareholders, and (2) the investment by the corporation of
undistributed earnings in assets having no reasonable connection with the
business. The mere fact that the corporation distributed a large part of its
earnings for the year in question does not necessarily prove that earnings were
not permitted to accumulate beyond reasonable needs or that the corporation was
not formed or availed of to avoid the tax upon shareholders.</span></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style",serif'>If the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue determined that the corporation was formed or availed of for
the purpose of avoiding the progressive rates of tax on individuals through the
medium of permitting earnings or profits to accumulate, and the taxpayer
contests such determination of fact by litigation, the burden of proving the
determination wrong by a preponderance of evidence, together with the
corresponding burden of first going forward with evidence, is on the taxpayer
under principles applicable to income tax cases generally, and this is so even
though the corporation is not a mere holding or investment company and does not
have an unreasonable accumulation of earnings or profits. However, if the
corporation is a mere holding or investment company, then the law gives further
weight to the presumption of correctness already arising from the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue's determination by expressly providing an additional
presumption of the existence of a purpose to avoid the tax upon shareholders,
while if earnings or profits are permitted to accumulate beyond the reasonable
needs of the business then the law adds still more weight to the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue's determination by providing that irrespective of whether
or not the corporation is a mere holding or investment company, the existence
of such an accumulation is determinative of the purpose to avoid the tax upon
shareholders unless the taxpayer proves the contrary by such a clear
preponderance of all the evidence that the absence of such a purpose is
unmistakable.</span></p>

buying and selling stocks, securities, real estate, or other investment

Unreasonable accumulation of profits.   An accumulation of earnings or profits
(including the undistributed earnings or profits of prior years) is
unreasonable if it is not required for the purposes of the business,
considering all the circumstances of the case. It is not intended, however, to
prevent accumulations of surplus for the reasonable needs of the business if
the purpose is not to prevent the imposition of the tax upon shareholders. No
attempt is here made to enumerate all the ways in which earnings or profits of
a corporation may be accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business.
Undistributed income is properly accumulated if retained for working capital
needed by the business; or if invested in additions to plant reasonably
required by the business; or if in accordance with contract obligations placed
to the credit of a sinking fund for the purpose of retiring bonds issued by the
corporation. The nature of the investment of earnings or profits is immaterial
if they are not in fact needed in the business. Among other things, the nature
of the business, the financial condition of the corporation at the close of the
taxable year, and the use of the undistributed earnings or profits will be
considered in determining the reasonableness of the accumulations.</span></p>

is not merely that which it has previously carried on, but includes in general
any line of business which it may undertake. However, a radical change of
business when a considerable surplus has been accumulated may afford evidence
of a purpose to avoid the tax. If one corporation owns the stock of another
corporation in the same or a related line of business and in effect operates
the other corporation, the business of the latter may be considered in
substance although not in legal form the business of the first corporation.
Earnings or profits of the first corporation put into the second through the
purchase of stock or otherwise may, therefore, if a subsidiary relationship is
established, constitute employment of the income in its own business. Investment
by a corporation of its income in stock and securities of another corporation
is not of itself to be regarded as employment of the income in its business.
The business of one corporation may not be regarded as including the business
of another unless the other corporation is a mere instrumentality of the first;
to establish this it is ordinarily essential that the first corporation own all
or substantially all of the stock of the second.   </span></p>

Mutual insurance companies and like organizations.   It is necessary to
exemption that the income of the company be derived solely from assessments,
dues, and fees collected from members. If income is received from other
sources, the corporation is not exempt. Income, however, from sources other
than those specified does not prevent exemption where its receipt is a mere
incident of the business of the company. Thus the receipt of interest upon a
working bank balance, or of the proceeds of the sale of badges, office
supplies, or equipment, will not defeat the exemption. The same is true of the
receipt of interest upon Government bonds, where they were purchased and were
afterwards sold. Where, however, such bonds are bought as a permanent
investment, the receipt of the interest destroys the exemption. The receipt of
what is, in substance, an entrance fee, charged by a mutual fire insurance
company as a condition of membership, does not render the company taxable,
although this fee is called a premium. If an organization issues policies for
stipulated cash premiums, or if it requires advance deposits to cover the cost
of the insurance and maintains investments from which income is derived, it is
not entitled to exemption. On the other hand, an organization may be entitled
to exemption, although it makes advance assessment for the sole purpose of
meeting future losses and expenses, provided that the balance of such
assessments remaining on hand at the end of the year is retained to meet losses
and expenses or is returned to members. An organization of a purely local

disposing of it or the products thereof and distributing the proceeds, less
necessary operating expenses, among their members upon the basis of the
quantity of milk or of butter fat in the milk furnished by such members are

A farmers' association is not exempt from taxation where in accounting to
farmers furnishing produce for the proceeds of sales it deducts more than the
necessary selling expenses incurred. Cooperative associations acting as
purchasing agents are not expressly exempt from tax, but rebates made to
purchasers, whether or not members of the association, in proportion to their
purchases may be excluded from gross income in computing the net income subject
to tax. Any profits made from non-members and distributed to members in the
guise of rebates are, of course, subject to tax.  </span></p>

Meaning of net income.   The tax imposed by law is upon income. In the
computation of the tax, various classes of income must be considered: (a)
Income, in the broad sense, meaning all wealth which flows into the tax-payer
other than as a mere return of capital. It includes the forms of income
specifically described as gains and profits, including gains derived from the
sale or other disposition of capital assets. Income cannot be determined merely
by reckoning cash receipts, for the statute recognizes as income determining
factor other items, among which are inventories, accounts receivable, property
exhaustion, and accounts payable for expenses incurred. (b) Gross income,
meaning income (in the broad sense) less income which is by statutory provision
or otherwise exempt from the tax imposed by law. (c) Net income, meaning gross
income less statutory deductions. The statutory deductions are, in general,
though not exclusively, expenditures other than capital expenditures, connected
with production of income. (d) In the case of a taxpayer other than a
corporation as defined in Section 84 (b) of the Code, net income means gross
income less exemptions. Ordinarily the net income is to be computed in
accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the
books of the taxpayer.</span></p>

Computation of net income.   Net income must be computed with respect to a
fixed period. That period is twelve months ending December 31st of every year
except in the case of a corporation filing returns on a fiscal year basis in
which case net income will be computed on the basis of such fiscal year. Items
of income and of expenditures, which as gross income and deductions, are
elements in the computation of net income, need not be in the form of cash. It
is sufficient that such items may be appraised in terms of money. The time as
of which any item of gross income or any deduction is to be accounted for must
be determined in the light of the fundamental rule that the computation shall
be made in such a manner as would clearly reflect the taxpayer's income. If the
method of accounting regularly employed by him in keeping his books clearly
reflects his income, it is to be followed with respect to the time as of which
items of gross income and deductions are to be accounted for, otherwise the
computation of net income shall be made in such manner as in the opinion of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue would clearly reflect it.</span></p>

of computation.   Approved standard methods of accounting will be ordinarily
regarded as clearly reflecting income. A method of accounting will not,
however, be regarded as clearly reflecting income unless all items of gross
income and all deductions are treated with reasonable consistency. All items of
gross income shall be included in the gross income for the taxable year in
which they are received by the taxpayer and deductions taken accordingly,
unless in order clearly to reflect income such amounts are to be properly
accounted for as of a different period. For instance, in any case in which it
is necessary to use an inventory, no accounting in regard to purchases and
sales will correctly reflect income except an accrual method. A taxpayer is
deemed to have received items of gross income which have been credited to or
set apart for him without restriction. On the other hand, appreciation in value
of property is not even an accrual of income to a taxpayer prior to the
realization of such appreciation through sale or conversion of the property.

Compensation for personal services.   Where no determination of compensation is
had until the completion of the services, the amount received is ordinarily
income for the taxable year of its determination, if the return is rendered on
the accrual basis; or, for the taxable year in which received, if the return is
rendered on a receipts and disbursements basis. Commissions paid salesman,
compensation for services on the basis of a percentage of profits, commissions
on insurance premiums, tips, and pensions or retiring allowances paid by
private persons or by the Government of the United States or of the Philippines
(except pensions exempt by law from tax) are income to the recipients; as are
also marriage fees, baptismal offerings, sums paid for saying masses for the
dead, and other contributions received by a clergyman, evangelists, or
religious worker for services rendered. However, so-called pensions awarded by

Forgiveness of indebtedness.   The cancellation and forgiveness of indebtedness
may amount to a payment of income, to a gift, or to a capital transaction,
dependent upon the circumstances. If, for example, an individual performs
services for a creditor, who, in consideration thereof cancels the debt, income
to that amount is realized by the debtor as compensation for his services. If,
however, a creditor merely desires to benefit a debtor and without any
consideration therefor cancels the debt, the amount of the debt is a gift from
the creditor to the debtor and need not be included in the latter's gross
income. If a corporation to which a stockholder is indebted forgives the debt,
the transaction has the effect of the payment of a dividend.</span></p>

income is to be reported.   Gains, profits, and income are to be included in
the gross income for the taxable year in which they are received by the
taxpayer, unless they are included when they accrue to him in accordance with
the approved method of accounting followed by him. If a person sues in one year
on a pecuniary claim or for property, and money or property is recovered on a
judgment therefore in a later year, income is realized in that year, assuming
that the money or property would have been income in the earlier year if then
received. This is true of a recovery for patent infringement. Bad debts or
accounts charged off subsequent to March 1, 1913, because of the fact that they
were determined to be worthless, which are subsequently recovered, whether or
not by suit, constitute income for the year in which recovered, regardless of
the date when amounts were charged off.</span></p>

Income constructively received.   Income which is credited to the account of or
set apart for a taxpayer and which may be drawn upon by him at any time is
subject to tax for the year during which so credited or set apart, although not
then actually reduced to possession. To constitute receipt in such a case the
income must be credited to the taxpayer without any substantial limitation or
restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment
is to be made. A book entry, if made, should indicate an absolute transfer from
one account to another. If the income is not credited, but is set apart, such
income must be unqualifiedly subject to the demand of the taxpayer. Where a
corporation contingently credits its employees with bonus stock, but the stock
is not available to such employees until some future date, the mere crediting
on the books of the corporation does not constitute receipt.</span></p>

Examples of constructive receipt.   When interest coupons have matured and are
payable, but have not been cashed, such interest payment though not collected
when due and payable, is nevertheless available to the taxpayer and should
therefore be included in his gross income for the year during which the coupons
matured. This is true if the coupons are exchanged for other property instead
of eventually being cashed. Defaulted coupons are income for the year in which
paid. The distributive share of the profits of a partner in a general
co-partnership duly registered is regarded as received by him, although not
distributed. Interest credited on savings bank deposits, even though the bank
nominally has a rule, seldom or never enforced, that it may require so many
days' notice in advance of cashing depositors' checks, is income to the
depositor when credited. An amount credited to shareholders of a building and
loan association, when such credit passes without restriction to the
shareholder, has taxable status as income for the year of the credit. When the
amount of such accumulations has not become available to the shareholder until
the maturity of a share, the amount of any share in excess of the aggregate
amount paid in by the shareholder is income for the year of maturity of the
share.   </span></p>

Compensation for personal services.   Among the ordinary and necessary expenses
paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business may be included a
reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for personal services
actually rendered. The test of deductibility in the case of compensation
payments is whether they are reasonable and are, in fact, payments purely for
service. This test and its practical application may be further stated and
illustrated as follows:</span></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

line-height:107%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style",serif'>(1)          Any amount
paid in the form of compensation, but not in fact as the purchase price of
services, is not deductible. (a) An ostensible salary paid by a corporation may
be a distribution of dividend on stock. This is likely to occur in the case of
a corporation having few shareholders, practically all of whom draw salaries.
If in such a case the salaries are in excess of those ordinarily paid for
similar services, and the excessive payment correspond or bear a close
relationship to the stockholdings of the officers or employees, it would seem
likely that the salaries are not paid wholly for services rendered, but that
the excessive payments are a distribution of earnings upon the stock. (b) An
ostensible salary may be in part payment for property. This may occur, for
example, where a partnership sells out to a corporation, the former partners
agreeing to continue in the service of the corporation. In such a case it may
be found that the salaries of the former partners are not merely for services,
but in part constitute payment for the transfers of their business.</span></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style",serif'>(2)          The form
or method of fixing compensation is not decisive as to deductibility. While any
form of contingent compensation invites scrutiny as a possible distribution of
earnings of the enterprise, it does not follow that payments on a contingent
basis are to be treated fundamentally on any basis different from that applying
to compensation at a flat rate. Generally speaking, if contingent compensation
is paid pursuant to a free bargain between the employer and the individual made
before the services are rendered, not influenced by any consideration on the
part of the employer other than that of securing on fair and advantageous terms
the services of the individual, it should be allowed as a deduction even though
in the actual working out of the contract it may prove to be greater than the
amount which would ordinarily be paid.</span></p>

line-height:107%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style",serif'>(3)          In any
event the allowance for compensation paid may not exceed what is reasonable in
all the circumstances. It is in general just to assume that reasonable and true
compensation is only such amount as would ordinarily be paid for like services
by like enterprises in like circumstances. The circumstances to be taken into
consideration are those existing at the date when the contract for services was
made, not those existing at the date when the contract is questioned.</span></p>

Treatment of excessive compensation.   The income tax liability of the
recipient in respect of an amount ostensibly paid to him as compensation, but
not allowed to be deducted as such by the payer, will depend upon the
circumstances of each case. Thus, in the case of excessive payments by
corporations, if such payments correspond or bear a close relationship to
stockholdings, and are found to be distribution of earnings or profits, the
excessive payments will be treated as dividend. If such payments constitute
payment for property, they should be treated by the payer as a capital
expenditure and by the recipient as part of the purchase price. </span></p>

reasonable compensation for the service rendered. It is immaterial whether such

Pensions, compensation for injuries.   Amounts paid for pensions to retired

expenses. Such deductions are limited to the amount not compensated for by
insurance or otherwise. When the amount of the salary of an officer or employee
is paid for a limited period after his death to his widow or heirs, in
recognition of the services rendered by the individual, such payments may be
deducted. Salaries paid by employers to employees who are absent in the
military, naval or other service of the Government, but who intend to return at

Rentals.   Where a leasehold is acquired for business purposes for a specified
sum, the purchaser may take as a deduction in his return an aliquot part of
such sum each year, based on the number of years the lease has to run. Taxes
paid by a tenant to or for a landlord for business property are additional rent
and constitute a deductible item to the tenant and taxable income to the
landlord, the amount of the tax being deductible by the latter. The cost borne
by a lessee in erecting buildings or making permanent improvements on ground of
which he is lessee is held to be a capital investment and not deductible as a
business expense. In order to return to such taxpayer his investment of
capital, an annual deduction may be made from gross income of an amount equal
to the cost of such improvements divided by the number of years remaining of
the term of lease, and such deduction shall be in lieu of a deduction for

Expenses of farmers.   A farmer who operates a farm for profit is entitled to
deduct from gross income as necessary expenses all amounts actually expended in
the carrying on of the business of farming. The cost of ordinary tools of short
life or small cost, such as hand tools, including shovels, rakes, etc., may be
included. The cost of feeding and raising livestock may be treated as an
expense deduction, in so far as such cost represents actual outlay, but not
including the value of farm produce grown upon the farm or the labor of the
taxpayer. Where a farmer is engaged in producing crops which take more than a
year from the time of planting to the process of gathering and disposal,
expenses deducted may be determined upon the crop basis, and such deductions
must be taken in the year in which the gross income from the crop has been
realized. The cost of farm machinery, equipment, and farm buildings represents
a capital investment and is not an allowable deduction as an item of expense.
Amounts expended in the development of farms, orchards, and ranches, prior to
the time when the productive state is reached may be regarded as investments of
capital. Amounts expended in purchasing work, breeding or dairy animals are
regarded as investments of capital, and may be depreciated unless such animals
are included in an inventory in accordance with Section 149 of these
regulations. The purchase price of transportation equipment even when wholly
used in carrying on farm operations, is not deductible but is regarded as an
investment of capital. The cost of gasoline or fuel, repairs, and upkeep of the
transportation equipment if used wholly in the business of farming is
deductible as an expense; if used partly for business purposes and partly for the
pleasure or convenience of the taxpayer or his family, such cost may be
apportioned according to the extent of the use for purposes of business and
pleasure or convenience, and only the proportion of such cost justly
attributable to business purposes is deductible as a necessary expense. If a
farm is operated for recreation or pleasure and not on a commercial basis, and
if the expenses incurred in connection with the farm are in excess of the
receipt therefrom, the entire receipts from the sale of products may be ignored
in rendering a return of income, and the expenses incurred, being regarded as
personal expenses, will not constitute allowable deduction.   </span></p>

charges are deductible.   Each year's return, so far as practicable, both as to
gross income and deductions therefrom, should be complete in itself, and
taxpayers are expected to make every reasonable effort to ascertain the facts
necessary to make a correct return. The expenses, liabilities, or deficit of
one year cannot be used to reduce the income of a subsequent year. A taxpayer
has the right to deduct all authorized allowances and it follows that if he
does not within any year deduct certain of his expenses, losses, interests,
taxes, or other charges, he can not deduct them from the income of the next or
any succeeding year. If it is recognized, however, that particularly in a going
business of any magnitude there are certain overlapping items both of income
and deduction, and so long as these overlapping items do not materially distort
the income, they may be included in the year in which the taxpayer, pursuant to
a consistent policy, takes them into his accounts. Judgments or other binding
judicial adjudication, on account of damages for patent infringement, personal
injuries, or other cause, are deductible from gross income when the claim is so
adjudicated or paid, unless taken under other methods of accounting which
clearly reflect the correct deduction, less any amount of such damages as may
have been compensated for by insurance or otherwise: If subsequent to its
occurrence, however, a taxpayer first ascertains the amount of a loss sustained
during a prior taxable year which has not been deducted from gross income, he
may render an amended return for such preceding taxable year including such
amount of loss in the deduction from gross income and may in proper cases file
a claim for refund of the excess tax paid by reason of the failure to deduct
such loss in the original return. A loss from theft or embezzlement occurring in
one year and discovered in another is ordinarily deductible for the year in
which sustained.</span></p>

Meaning of terms.   The &quot;amount of any income, war-profits, and
excess-profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year&quot; means taxes
proper (no credit being given for amounts representing interest or penalties)

Conditions of allowance of credits.   If the taxpayer signifies in his return
his desire to claim credit for income, war-profits, or excess-profits taxes

sworn to or affirmed. If credit is sought for taxes already paid the form must
have attached to it the receipt for each such tax payment. If credit is sought
for taxes accrued, the form must have attached to it the return on which each
such accrued tax was based. This receipt or return so attached must be either

Domestic corporation owning a majority of the stock of foreign corporation.
In the case of a domestic corporation which owns a majority of the voting stock
of a foreign corporation from which it receives dividends in any taxable rear,
the credit for foreign taxes includes not only the income, war profits and
excess-profits taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year to any foreign

proceeds to raze with a view to erecting thereon another building, it will be

actual loss sustained. In determinating the amount of the loss, adjustment must
be made, however, for improvements, depreciation and the salvage value of the
property. This exception to the rule requiring a sale or other disposition of
property in order to establish a loss requires proof of some unforeseen cause
by reason of which the property has been prematurely discarded, as, for
example, where an increase in the cost or change in the manufacture of any
product makes it necessary to abandon such manufacture, to which special
machinery is exclusively devoted, or where new legislation directly or

of farmers.   Losses incurred in the operation of farms as business enterprises
are deductible from gross income. If farm products are held for favorable
markets, no deduction on account of shrinkage in weight or physical value or by
deterioration in storage shall be allowed, except as such shrinkage may be
reflected in an inventory if used to determine profits. The total loss by
storm, flood, or fire of a prospective crop is not a deductible loss in
computing net income. A farmer engaged in raising and selling stock, cattle,
sheep, horses, etc., is not entitled to claim as a loss the value of animals
that perish from among those animals that were raised on the farm, except as
such loss is reflected in an inventory if used. If livestock has been purchased
after March 1, 1913, for any purpose, and afterwards dies from disease,
exposure, or injury, or is killed by order of the authorities, the actual
purchase price of such stock, less any depreciation allowable as a deduction in
computing net income, with respect to such perished, livestock, and also any
insurance or indemnity recovered, may be deducted as a loss. The actual cost of
other property (with proper adjustment for depreciation), which is destroyed by
order of the authorities, may in like manner be claimed as a loss; but if
reimbursement is made in whole or in part on account of stock killed or
property destroyed, the amount received shall be reported as income for the
year in which reimbursement is made. The cost of any feed, pasturage, or care
which has been deducted as an expense of operation shall not be included as
part of the cost of the stock for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of a
deductible loss. If gross income is ascertained by inventories, no deduction
can be made for livestock or products lost during the year, whether purchased
for resale, produced on the farm, as such losses will be reflected in the
inventory by reducing the amount of livestock or products on hand at the close
of the year. If an individual owns and operates a farm, in addition to being
engaged in another trade, business or calling, and sustains a loss from such
operation of the farm, then the amount of loss sustained may be deducted from
gross income received from all sources, provided the farm is not operated for
recreation or pleasure.   </span></p>

year, the same may be allowed as a deduction in computing net income. There
should accompany the return a statement showing the propriety of any deduction
claimed for bad debts. Before a taxpayer may charge off and deduct a debt, he

certainty, the uncollectibility of the debt. Any amount subsequently received
on account of a bad debt previously charged off and allowed as a deduction for
income tax purposes, must he included in gross income for the taxable year in

deduction. Bankruptcy is generally an indication of the worthlessness of at
least a part of an unsecured and unpreferred debt. Actual determination of
worthlessness in bankruptcy is sometimes possible before and at other times
only when a settlement in bankruptcy shall have been had. Where a taxpayer
ascertained a debt to be worthless and charged it off in one year, the mere
fact that bankruptcy proceedings instituted against the debtor are terminated
in a later year, confirming the conclusion that the debt is worthless, will not
authorize shifting the deduction to such later year. If a taxpayer computes his
income upon the basis of valuing his notes or accounts receivable at their fair
market value when received, which may be less than their face value, the amount
deductible for bad debts in any case is limited to such original valuation.</span></p>

unless the income such items represent has been included in the return of

Depreciation.   A reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear, and
obsolescence of property used in the trade or business may be deducted from
gross income. For convenience such an allowance will usually be referred to as
depreciation, excluding from the term any idea of a mere reduction in market
value not resulting from exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence. The proper
allowance for such depreciation of any property used in the trade or business
is that amount which should be set aside for the taxable year in accordance
with a reasonable consistent plan whereby the aggregate of the amount so set
aside, plus the salvage value, will, at the end of the useful life of the
property in business, equal the basis of the property. Due regard must also be
given to expenditures for current upkeep.   </span></p>

Depreciable property.   The necessity for a depreciation allowance arises from
the fact that certain property used in the business gradually approaches a
point where its usefulness is exhausted. The allowances should be confined to
property of this nature. In the case of tangible property, it applies to that
which is subject to wear and tear, to decay or decline from natural causes, to
exhaustion and to obsolescence due to the normal progress of the art, as where
machinery or other property must be replaced by a new invention, or due to the
inadequacy of the property to the growing needs of the business. It does not
apply to inventories or to stock in trade, nor to land apart from the
improvements or physical development added to it. It does not apply to bodies
of minerals which through the process of removal suffer depletion. Property
kept in repair may, nevertheless, be the subject of a depreciation allowance.
The deduction of an allowance for depreciation is limited to property used in
the taxpayer's trade or business. No such allowance may be made in respect to
automobiles or other transportation equipment used solely for the pleasure, a
building used by the taxpayer solely as his residence, nor in respect of
furniture or furnishings therein, personal effects, or clothing; but properties
and costumes used exclusively in a business, such as theatrical business, may
be the subject of a depreciation allowance.</span></p>

Depreciation of intangible property.   Intangibles, the use of which in the
trade or business is definitely limited in duration, may be the subject of a
depreciation allowance. Examples are patents, copyrights, and franchises.
Intangibles, the use of which in the business or trade is not so limited, will
not usually be a proper subject of such an allowance. If however, an intangible
asset acquired through capital outlay is known from experience to be of value
in the business for only a limited period, the length of which can be estimated
from experience with reasonable certainty, such intangible asset may be the
subject of a depreciation allowance, provided the facts are fully shown in the
return or prior thereto to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue.</span></p>

Capital sum recoverable through depreciation allowances.   The capital sum to
be replaced by depreciation allowances is the cost or other basis of the
property in respect of which the allowance is made. To this amount should be
added from time to time the cost of improvements, additions, and betterment and
from it should be deducted from time to time the amount of any definite loss or
damage sustained by the property through casualty, as distinguished from the
gradual exhaustion of its utility which is the basis of the depreciation
allowance. Where the lessee of real property erects buildings, or makes
permanent improvements which become part of the realty and income has been
returned by the lessor as a result thereof, as provided in Section 49 of these
regulations, the capital sum to be replaced by depreciation allowance is the
same as though no such buildings had been erected or such improvements made. No
depreciation deduction will be allowed in the case of property which has been
amortized to its scrap value and is no longer in use.   </span></p>

of computing depreciation allowance.   The capital sum to be replaced should be
charged off over the useful life of the property, either in equal annual
installments or in accordance with any other recognized trade practice, such as
an apportionment of the capital sum over units of production. Whatever plan or
method of apportionment is adopted must be reasonable and must have due regard
to operating conditions during the taxable period. While the burden of proof
must rest upon the taxpayer to sustain the deductions taken by him, such
deductions must not be disallowed unless shown by clear and convincing evidence
to be unreasonable. The reasonableness of any claim for depreciation shall be
determined upon the conditions known to exist at the end of the period for
which the return is made. If it develops that the useful life of the property
will be longer or shorter than the useful life as originally estimated under
all the then known facts, the portion of the cost or other basis of the
property not already provided for through depreciation allowances should be
spread over the remaining useful life of the property as reestimated in the

Obsolescence.   With respect to physical property the whole or any portion of
which is clearly shown by the taxpayer as being affected by economic conditions
that will result in its being abandoned at a future date prior to the end of
its normal useful life, so that depreciation deductions alone are insufficient
to return the cost (or other basis) at the end of its economic term of
usefulness, a reasonable deduction for obsolescence, in addition to
depreciation, may be allowed in accordance with the facts obtaining with
respect to each item of property concerning which a claim for obsolescence is
made. No deductions for obsolescence will be permitted merely because, in the
opinion of a taxpayer, the property may become obsolete at some later date.
This allowance will be confined to such portion of the property on which
obsolescence is definitely shown to be sustained and can not be held applicable
to an entire property unless all portions thereof are affected by the conditions
to which obsolescence is found to be due.</span></p>

Depreciation of patent or copyright.   In computing depreciation allowance in
the case of a patent or copyright, the capital sum to be replaced is the cost
or other basis of the patent or copyright. The allowance should be computed by
an apportionment of the cost or other basis of the patent or copyright over the
life of the patent or copyright since its grant, or since its acquisition by
the taxpayer, or since March 1, 1913, as the case may be. If the patent or
copyright was acquired from the Government, its cost consists of the various
Government fees, cost of drawings, experimental models, attorney's fees,
development or experimental expenses, etc., actually paid. Deprecation of a
patent can be taken on the basis of the fair market value as of March 1, 1913,
only when affirmative and satisfactory evidence of such value is offered. Such
evidence should whenever practicable be submitted with the return. If the
patent becomes obsolete prior to its expiration, such proportion of the amount
on which its depreciation may be based as the number of years of its remaining
life bears to the whole number of years intervening between the basic date when
it legally expires may be deducted, if permission to do so is specifically
secured from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Owing to the difficulty of
allocating to a particular year the obsolescence of a patent, such permission
will be granted only if affirmative and satisfactory evidence that the patent
became obsolete in the year for which the return is made is submitted to the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The fact that depreciation has not been taken
in prior years does not entitle the taxpayer to deduct in any taxable year a
greater amount for depreciation than would otherwise be allowable.   </span></p>

from experience with reasonable accuracy, it may be the subject of depreciation

to deduct depletion.   In order to be entitled to percentage depletion
allowance, the taxpayer must have an economic interest in the property. To
acquire an economic interest, the taxpayer must have a capital investment in
the property and not a mere economic advantage. The taxpayer must have acquired
at least, by investment, any interest in oil or gas or mineral in place, and
secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction
of the oil, gas or mineral, to which he must look for a return of his capital.
Thus the parties entitled to share in oil or mineral extracted, or the gross
proceeds therefrom (including the parties to a lease providing for royalty
payments of stated amounts per unit mined) have economic interests in the oil
or minerals in place. That is, they, as owners of the rights in oil or other
mineral in place, share the income from production, and the depletion
allowances thereon are regarded as designed to permit tax-free recovery of at
least their capital investments in such property rights.</span></p>

income.   Gross income means the &quot;gross income from the property&quot;.
The gross income in the case of gas and oil wells is the amount for which the

oil and gas are not sold on the property but are manufactured or converted into

the property&quot; means, in the case of mines, the gross income from mining.
The gross income from mining consists of the proceeds from the sales of ores or
minerals extracted from the mining property. Where ores are sent abroad where
the ordinary treatment processes are applied or where they are refined and
where they are sold, the actual cost of ocean freight as well as insurance,
should be deducted from the actual selling price for gross income purposes. Also
where minerals or mineral products are sold or consigned abroad by the lessee
or owner of the mine under C.I.F. terms, the actual cost of ocean freight and
insurance should be deducted.   </span></p>

banks is included in determining &quot;gross income from the property&quot;.
The length of time between the prior mining and extraction of ores or minerals
from the waste or residue of such mining is immaterial. Whether the waste or
residue results from the application of ordinary treatment processes or from
the process of removal from the ground, income derived therefrom is within the
term &quot;gross income from the property&quot;. To be included in &quot;gross
income from the property&quot;, income derived from the extraction of ores or
minerals from the waste or residue of prior mining must come from such
extraction by the mine owner or operator himself.</span></p>

Special deductions allowed mutual insurance companies.   Mutual insurance
companies (other than mutual life and mutual marine insurance companies), which
require their members to make premium deposits to provide for losses and
expenses, are allowed to deduct from gross income the aggregate amount of
premium deposits returned to their policyholders or retained for the payment of
losses, expenses, and reinsurance reserves. In determining the amount of premium
deposits retained by a mutual fire or mutual casualty insurance company for the
payment of losses, expenses, and reinsurance reserves, it will be presumed that
losses and expenses have been paid out of earnings and profits other than
premiums to the extent of such earnings and profits. If, however, any portion
of such amount is applied during. the taxable year to the payment of losses,
expenses, or reinsurance reserves, or which a separate allowance is taken, then
such portion is not deductible; and if any portion of such amount for which an
allowance is taken is subsequently applied to the payment of expenses, losses,
or reinsurance reserves, then such payment can not be separately deducted. The
amount of premium deposits retained for the payment of expenses and losses and
the amount of such expenses and losses, may not both be deducted. A company
which invests part of the premium deposits so retained by it in
interest-bearing securities may, nevertheless, deduct such part, but not the
interest received on such securities. A mutual fire insurance company which has
a guaranty capital is taxed like other mutual fire insurance companies. A stock
fire insurance company operated on the mutual plan to the extent of paying
dividends to certain classes of policyholders, may make a return on the same
basis as a mutual fire insurance company with respect to its business conducted
on the mutual plan.</span></p>

Special deductions allowed mutual marine insurance companies.   Mutual marine
insurance companies should include in gross income the gross premiums collected
and received by them less amounts paid for reinsurance. They may deduct from
gross income amounts repaid to policyholders on account of premiums previously
paid by them together with the interest actually paid upon such amounts between
the date of ascertainment and the date of payment thereof. The remainder of the
premiums accordingly forms part of the net income of the company, except to the
extent that it is subject to then deductions allowed such insurance companies

addition to reserve funds.   All policy premiums on which net addition to

deduct from gross income the net addition required by law to be made within the

than at the beginning of the year there is a &quot;released reserve&quot;, and
the amount so released must be included in gross income. In the case of
assessment insurance companies, whether domestic or foreign, the actual deposit
of sums with the officers of the Government of the Philippines, pursuant to
law, as addition to guaranty or reserve funds shall be treated as being
payments required by law to reserve funds. In the case of life insurance

for determining gain or loss from sale of property.   For the purpose of
ascertaining the gain or loss from the sale or exchange of property, the basis
is the cost of such property, or in the case of property which should be included
in the inventory, its latest inventory value. But in the case of property
acquired before March 1, 1913, when its fair market value as of that date is in
excess of its cost, the gain to be included in gross income is the excess of
the amount realized therefor over such fair market value. (See illustration I,
Section 137 of these regulations). Also in the case of property acquired before
March 1, 1913, when its fair market value as of that date is lower than its
cost the deductible loss is the excess of such fair market value over the
amount realized therefor. (See Illustration II, Id.). No gain or loss is
recognized in the case of property sold or exchanged (a) at more than cost but
less than its fair market value as of March 1, 1913 (See Illustration III,
Id.), or (b) at less than cost but at more than its fair market value as of
March 1, 1913. (See Illustration IV, Id., Id., Id.) In any case proper
adjustment must be made in computing gain or loss from the exchange or sale of
property for any depreciation or depletion sustained and allowable as deduction
in computing net income; the amount of depreciation previously charged off by
the taxpayer shall be deemed to be true depreciation sustained unless shown by
clear and convincing evidence to be incorrect. What the fair market value of
property was as of March 1, 1913, is a question of fact to be established by
evidence which will reasonably and adequately make it appear. The nature and
extent of the sales and the circumstances under which they were made should be
considered. Prices received at forced sales or for small lots of property may
be and often are no real indication of the value of the amount of property in
question. For instance, sales from time to time of a small number of shares of
stock is little indication of the value of a large or controlling interest in
the corporation. If the taxpayer can not determine the cost of securities
purchased prior to March 1, 1913, because of the loss, destruction, or failure
to keep records, the value of the securities at the date of approximate date of
acquisition may be used in determining the cost basis for purposes of computing
the gain or loss from the sale of the securities. When the date or approximate
date of acquisition is unknown, no general rule can be stated for determining
the cost value of such securities. Each case must be considered separately upon
its own facts.   </span></p>

Exchange of property.   Gain or loss arising from the acquisition and
subsequent disposition of property is realized only when as the result of a
transaction between the owner and another person the property is converted into
other property (a) that is essentially different from the property disposed of,
and (b) that has a market value. The requirement that the property received in
exchange must be &quot;essentially different from the property disposed
of&quot; implies that there must be a change in substance and not merely a
change in form. By way of illustration, if a taxpayer owning ten shares of
stock exchanges his stock certificate for a voting trust certificate, no income
is realized. The term &quot;market value&quot; means the fair value of the
property in money as between one who wishes to purchase and one who wishes to
sell. It is not, however, what can be obtained for the property when the owner
is under peculiar compulsion to sell or the purchaser to buy; nor is it a
purely speculative value which an owner could not reasonably expect to obtain
for the property although he might possibly be fortunate enough to do so.
&quot;Market value&quot; is the price at which a seller willing to sell at a
fair price and a buyer willing to buy at a fair price, both having reasonable
knowledge of the facts, will trade. Evidence as to the assets and liabilities
of a corporation and as to its earnings may furnish definite indications of the
market value of its stock.</span></p>

Determination of gain or loss from the exchange of property.   The amount of

Readjustment of interest in a registered copartnership.   When a partner
retires from a duly registered copartnership, or the partnership is dissolved,
he realizes a gain or loss measured by the difference between the price
received for his interest and the cost to him of his interest in the
partnership including in such cost the amount of his share in any undistributed
partnership net income earned since he became a partner on which the income tax
has been paid. However, if such interest in the partnership was acquired prior to
March 1, 1913, both the cost as hereinbefore provided and the amount of such
interest as of date, plus the amount of the shares in any undistributed
partnership net income earned since March 1, 1913, on which the income tax has
been paid, shall be ascertained and the taxable gain derived or the deductible
loss sustained shall be computed as provided in Sections 136 and 137 of these
regulations. If the partnership distributes its assets in kind and not in cash,
the partner realizes gain or suffers loss according to the market value of the
property received in liquidation. Whenever a new partner is admitted, to a
partnership, or any existing partnership is reorganized, the facts as to such
change or reorganization should be fully set forth in the next return of
income, in order that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may determine
whether any gain or loss has been realized by any partner.   ADTCaI</span></p>

the original basis which the market value of the particular class bears to the
market value of all securities received on the date of the exchange, for
purposes of determining the gain or loss on the subsequent sale of any of the
new securities. For example, if 100 shares of common stock par value P100, are
exchanged for 50 shares of preferred and 50 shares of common each of P100 par
value, and the cost of the old stock was P250 per share, or P25,000, but the
market value of the preferred stock on the date of the exchange was P110 per
share, or P5,500 for the 50 shares, and the market value of the common was P440
per share or P22,000 for the 50 shares of common, one-fifth of the original
cost, or P5,000, would be regarded as the cost of the preferred and
four-fifths, or P20,000 as the cost of the common. </span></p>

nontaxable exchange trades A stock which cost P100 for one share of common
stock and one share of preferred stock of B corporation, together worth P100
(P100 each), and P50 cash. The basis for the share of B common stock will

inventories.   In order to reflect the net income correctly, inventories at the
beginning and end of each year are necessary in every case in which the
production, purchase or sale of merchandise is an income producing factor. The
inventory should include raw materials and supplies on hand that have been
acquired for sale, consumption, or use in productive processes together with
all finished or partly finished goods. Only merchandise title to which is
vested in the taxpayer should be included in his inventory. Accordingly the
seller should include in his inventory goods under contract for sale but not
yet segregated and applied to the contract and goods out upon consignment, but
should exclude from inventory goods sold, title to which has passed to the purchaser.
A purchaser should include in inventory merchandise purchased, title to which
has passed to him although such merchandise is in transit or for other reasons
has not been reduced to physical possession, but should not include goods
ordered for future delivery transfer of title to which has not yet been
effected.</span></p>

Valuation of inventories.   The law provides two tests to which each inventory
must conform.   (1) It must conform as nearly as possible to the best
accounting practice in the trade or business, and (2) it must clearly reflect
the income. It follows, therefore, that inventory rules can not be uniform but
must give effect to trade customs which come within the scope of the best
accounting practice in the particular trade or business. In order to clearly
reflect income, the inventory practice of a taxpayer should be consistent from
year to year, and greater weight is to be given to consistency than to any
particular method of inventory or basis of valuation, as long as the method or
basis used is substantially in accord with these regulations. An inventory that
can be used under the best accounting practice in a balance sheet showing the
financial position of the taxpayer is, as a general rule, regarded as clearly
reflecting his income.</span></p>

most commonly used by business concerns and which meet the requirements of the
Income Tax Law are (a) cost price or (b) cost or market price, whichever is the
lower. Any goods in an inventory which are unsalable at normal prices or
unusable in the normal way because of damage, imperfections, shop wear, changes
of style, odd or broken lots, or other similar causes, including second hand
goods taken in exchange, should be valued at &quot;bona fide&quot; selling
prices whether basis (a) or (b) is used, or if such goods consist of raw
materials or partly finished goods held for use or consumption, they should be
valued upon a reasonable basis, taking into consideration the usability and the
condition of the goods, but in no case shall such value be less than the scrap
value. &quot;Bona fide&quot; selling price means actual offerings of goods
during a period ending not later than thirty days after inventory date. The
burden of proof will rest upon the taxpayer to show that such exceptional goods
as are valued upon such selling bases come within the classifications indicated
above, and he shall maintain such records of the disposition of the goods as
will enable a verification of the inventory to be made.   </span></p>

either basis (a) or (b) for their 1921 inventories, and the basis adopted for that
year is controlling and a change can now be made after permission is secured
from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Goods taken in the inventory which
have been so intermingled that they can not be identified with specific
invoices will be deemed to be either (a) the goods most recently purchased or
produced and the cost thereof will be the actual cost of the goods purchased or
produced during the period in which the quantity of goods in the inventory has
been acquired, or (b) where the taxpayer maintains book inventories in
accordance with a sound accounting system in which the respective inventory
accounts are charged with the actual cost of the goods purchased or produced
and credited with the value of the goods used, transferred, or sold, calculated
upon the basis of the actual cost of the goods acquired during the taxable year
(including the inventory at the beginning of the year) the net value as shown

the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. A dealer in securities in whose books of
accounts separate computations of the gain or loss from the sale of the various
lots of securities sold are made on the basis of the cost of each lot shall be
regarded, for the purposes of this section, as regularly inventorying his
securities at cost. For the purposes of this rule a dealer in securities is a
merchant of securities, whether an individual, partnership; or corporation,
with an established place of business, regularly engaged in the purchase of
securities and their resale to customers; that is, one who as a merchant buys
securities and sells them to customers with a view to the gains and profits
that may be derived therefrom. If such business is simply a branch of the
activities carried on by such person, the securities inventoried as here
provided may include only those held for purposes of resale and not for
investment. Taxpayers who buy and sell or hold securities for investment or
speculation, irrespective of whether such buying or selling constitutes the
carrying on of a trade or business, and officers of corporations and members of
partnerships who in their individual capacities buy and sell securities, are
not dealers in securities within the meaning of this rule.</span></p>

Inventories of livestock raisers and other farmers.   (1) Farmers may change
the basis of their returns from that of receipts and disbursements to that of
an inventory basis, which necessitates the use of opening and closing
inventories for the year in which the change is made. There should be included
in the opening inventory all farm products (including livestock) purchased or
raised which were on hand at the date of the inventory, but inventories must
not include real estate, buildings, permanent improvements, or any other fixed
assets.   </span></p>

the difficulty of ascertaining actual cost of livestock and other farm
products, farmers who render their returns upon an inventory basis may at their
option value their inventories for the current taxable year according to the &quot;farm-price
method&quot; which provides for the valuation of inventories at market price
less cost of marketing. If the use of the &quot;farm-price method&quot; of
valuing inventories for any taxable year involves a change in method of pricing
inventories from that employed in prior years, the opening inventory for the
taxable year in which the change is made should be brought in at the same value
as the closing inventory for the preceding taxable year. If such valuation of
the opening inventory for the taxable year in which the change is made results
in an abnormally large income for that year, there may be submitted with the
return for such taxable year an adjustment statement for the preceding year
based on the &quot;farm-price method&quot; of valuing inventories; upon the
amount of which adjustments the tax, if any be due, shall be assessed and paid
at the rate of tax in effect for such preceding year.</span></p>

adhered to unless a change is authorized by the Commissioner of Internal

otherwise disposes of personal property on the installment plan, whether or not
title remains in the vendor until the property is fully paid for, may return as
income therefrom in any taxable year that proportion of the installment
payments actually received in that year which the total or gross profit (that
is, sales less cost of goods sold) realized or to be realized when the property
is paid for, bears to the total contract price. Thus the income of a dealer in
personal property on the installment plan may be ascertained by taking as income
that proportion of the total payments received in the taxable year from
installment sales (such payments being allocated to the year against the sales
of which they apply) which the total or gross profit realized or to be realized
on the total installment sales made during each year bears to the total
contract price of all such sales made during that respective year. No payments
received in the taxable year shall be excluded in computing the amount of
income to be returned on the ground that they were received under a sale the
total profit from which was returned as income during a taxable year or years
prior to the change by the taxpayer to the installment basis of returning
income. Deductible items are not to be allocated to the years in which the
profits from the sales of a particular year are to be returned as income, but
must be deducted for the taxable year in which the items are &quot;paid or
incurred&quot; or &quot;paid or accrued&quot;, as provided by Section 40 and
84(q) of the Code. A dealer who desires to compute his income on the
installment basis shall maintain books of account in such a manner as to enable
an accurate computation to be made on such basis in accordance with the

wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion of the property during
the period the property was in the hands of the purchaser had the sale not been
made will constitute gain or loss, as the case may be to the vendor for the
year in which the property is repossessed, and the basis of the property in the
hands of the vendor will be the original basis at the time of the sale plus the
fair market value at the time of repossession, of fixed improvements placed on
the property by the purchaser. If the vendor has previously transferred title
to the purchaser, and the purchaser defaults in any of his payments and the
vendor reacquired the property, such reacquisition shall be regarded as a
transfer by the vendor, in exchange for the property for such of the
purchaser's obligations as are applied by the vendor to the purchase or bid
price of the property. Such an exchange will be regarded as having resulted in
the realization by the vendor of gain or loss, as the case may be for the year
of reacquisition, measured by the difference between the fair market value of
the property including fixed improvements placed by the purchaser on the
property, and the amount of the obligations of the purchaser which were applied
by the vendor to the purchase or bid price of the property. The fair market
value of the property reacquired shall be presumed to be the amount for which
it is bid in by the vendor in the absence of clear and convincing proof to the
contrary. If the property reacquired is subsequently sold the basis for
determining gain or loss is the fair market value of the property at the date
of reacquisition including the fair market value of the fixed improvements
placed on the property by the purchaser.   </span></p>

reality of the control which is decisive, not its form or the mode of its

which would have resulted to the controlled taxpayer, had it in the conduct of
its affairs (or, as the case may be, in the particular contract, transaction,
arrangement, or other act) dealt with the other member or members of the group
at arm's length. It does not mean the income, the deductions, or the item or

particular contract, transaction, or arrangement, the controlled taxpayer, or
the interests controlling it, chose to make (even though such contract,
transaction, or arrangement be legally binding upon the parties thereto).</span></p>

line-height:107%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style",serif'>(b)          SCOPE AND
PURPOSE.   The purpose of Section 44 is to place a controlled taxpayer on a tax
parity with an uncontrolled taxpayer, by determining, according to the standard
of an uncontrolled taxpayer, the true net income from the property and business
of a controlled taxpayer. The interests controlling a group of controlled
taxpayers are assumed to have complete power to cause each controlled taxpayer
so to conduct its affairs that its transactions and accounting record truly
reflect the net income from the property and business of each of the controlled
taxpayers. If, however, this has not been done, and the taxable net incomes are
thereby understated, the statute contemplates that the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue shall intervene, and, by making such distributions, apportionments, or
allocations as he may deem necessary of gross income or deductions, or of any
item or element affecting net income, between/or among the controlled taxpayers
constituting the group, shall determine the true net income of each controlled
taxpayer dealing at arm's length with another uncontrolled taxpayer. The
standard to be applied in every case is that of an uncontrolled taxpayer.
Section 44 grants no right to a controlled taxpayer to apply its provisions at
will, nor does it grant any right to compel the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue to apply such provisions.</span></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;

line-height:107%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style",serif'>(c)           APPLICATION.
  Transactions between the controlled taxpayer and another will be subjected to
special scrutiny to ascertain whether the common control is being used to
reduce, avoid, or escape taxes. In determining the true net income of a
controlled taxpayer, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is not restricted to
the case of improper accounting, to the case of a fraudulent, colorable, or
sham transaction, or to the case of a device designed to reduce or avoid tax by
shifting or distorting income or deductions. The authority to determine true
net income extends to any case in which either by inadvertence or design the
taxable net income in whole or in part, of a controlled taxpayer, is other than
it would have been had the taxpayer in the conduct of his affairs been an
uncontrolled taxpayer dealing at arm's length with another uncontrolled
taxpayer.</span></p>

revocable trust (Section 59); (2) in the case of a trust the income of which,
in whole or in part, may be held or distributed for the benefit of the grantor
(Section 60); and (3) in the case of a trust administered in a foreign country
[Section 57(c)]. In the first case, the income from such part of the trust
estate title to which may be revested in the grantor should be included in the
grantor's return. In the second case, part of the income of the trust, which
may be held or distributed for the benefit of the grantor, should be included
in the grantor's return. In the third case, the trustee is not entitled to the
deductions mentioned in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 57 and the net
income of the trust undiminished by any amounts distributed, paid or credited
to beneficiaries will be taxed to the trustees; however, the income included in
the return of the trustees is not to be included in computing the income of the
beneficiaries.</span></p>

Estates and trusts taxed to fiduciary.   In the case of a decedent's estate the
settlement of which is the object of testamentary or intestate proceedings, the
fiduciary, executor, or administrator is required to file an annual return for
the estate up to the final settlement thereof. In the same manner, the
fiduciary is required to file a yearly return covering the income of a trust,
whether created by will or deed, for accumulation of income, whether for
unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests or otherwise. In
both cases the income of the estate or trust is taxed to the fiduciary. Where
under the terms of a will or deed, the trustee, may in his discretion,
distribute the income or accumulate it, the income is taxed to the trustee,
irrespective of the exercise of his discretion. The imposition of the tax is
not affected by the fact that an ultimate beneficiary may be a person exempt
from tax.</span></p>

the income is taxable directly to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Each

commodities include gains from futures transactions in any commodity on or

include gains from cash transactions or gains by a producer, processor,
merchant, or handler of the commodity, which arise out of bonafide hedging
transactions reasonably necessary to the conduct of its business in the manner
in which such business is customarily and usually conducted by others. In
general, personal holding company income includes gains on futures contracts
which are speculative. Futures contracts representing true hedges against price
fluctuations in spot goods are not speculative transactions, though not
concurrent with spot transactions. Futures contracts which are not hedges
against spot transactions are speculative unless they are hedges against
concurrent futures or forward sales or purchases.</span></p>

Philippine shareholder in the foreign personal holding company, that is, by the
number of shares of stock owned by the Philippine shareholder and the relative
rights of his class of stock, if there are several classes of stock

corporations, the amount of such dividends includible for purposes of the tax

capital account is not subject to income tax. However a dividend in stock may
constitute taxable income to the recipients thereof notwithstanding the fact that
the officers or directors of the corporation (as defined in Section 84) choose
to call such distribution as a stock dividend. The distinction between a stock
dividend which does not, and one which does, constitute income taxable to the
shareholder is the distinction between a stock dividend which works no change
in the corporate entity, the same interest in the same corporation being
represented after the distribution by more shares of precisely the same
character, and a stock dividend where there either has been a change of
corporate identity or a change in the nature of the shares issued as dividends
whereby the proportional interest of the shareholders after the distribution is
essentially different from his former interests. A stock dividend constitutes
income if it gives the shareholder an interest different from that which his
former stock holdings represented. A stock dividend does not constitute income
if the new shares confer no different rights or interests than did the old
the new certificates plus the old representing the same proportionate interest

distribution made by a corporation is made out of earnings or profits to the
extent thereof and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits. In
determining the source of a distribution, consideration should be given first,
to the earnings or profits of the taxable year; second, to the earnings or
profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, only in the case where, and to the
extent that, the distribution made during the taxable year are not regarded as
out of the earnings or profits of the taxable year and all the earnings or
profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, have been distributed; and,
fourth, to sources other than earnings or profits only after the earnings or
profits have been distributed.</span></p>

Distribution in liquidation.   In all cases where a corporation (as defined in
Section 84) distributes all of its property or assets in complete liquidation
or dissolution, the gain realized from the transaction by the stockholder,
whether individual or corporate, is taxable to the extent recognized in Section
34(b) of the Code. For this purpose, the term &quot;complete liquidation&quot;
includes any one of a series of distributions made by a corporation in complete
cancellation or redemption of all of its stock in accordance with a bona fide
plan of liquidation under which the transfer of all the assets under
liquidation is to be complete within a reasonable time from the date of the
first distribution, usually not to exceed one year from the time of such first
distribution. If the amount received by the stockholder in liquidation is less
than the cost or other basis of the stock, the loss in the transaction is
deductible to the extent allowed in Section 34(c) of the Code.</span></p>
