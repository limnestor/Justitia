                    Priority over Denomination.</i> - The use of a denomination shall not be granted to a breeder if
                such denomination has already been registered to another breeder or is being used by a third party in
                relation to the sale or offering for sale of a particular variety prior to the filing date or priority
                date of an application for a Certificate of Plant Variety Protection. In case two (2) or more
                breeders/applicants apply for the registration of the same denomination, the breeder/applicant who has
                the earliest filing date or priority date shall have the right to register the same to the exclusion of
                the other applicant/breeder(s).<br><br>SEC. 11.<i> Figures as Denomination.</i> - The denomination must
                enable the variety to be identified. It may not consist solely of figures except when it is an
                established practice for designating such a variety.<br><br>SEC. 12. <i>Misleading Denomination.</i> -
                No denomination shall be accepted if it is liable to mislead or to cause confusion concerning the
                characteristic value or identity of the variety or identity of the breeder.<br><br>SEC. 13. <i>Refusal
                    of Denomination.</i>- If the denomination does not satisfy these requirements, its registration
                shall be refused and the breeder shall be required to propose another denomination within a prescribed
                period. The denomination shall be registered together with the grant of the breeder's right.<br><br>SEC.
                14.<i> Denomination Used in an Application Previously Filed Abroad.</i> - An application filed in this
                country, the subject matter of which is the same as that of an application previously filed abroad,
                shall use the same denomination as the latter.&nbsp; However, if such denomination does not conform to
                the provisions of this Title, the applicant/breeder shall be required to submit a new
                denomination.<br><br>SEC. 15. <i>Obligation to Use Denomination.</i> - Any person, who offers for sale
                or markets in the Philippines, propagating material of a variety protected, shall be obliged to use the
                denomination of that variety, even after the expiration of the breeder's right therefor except when the
                rule of prior rights apply.<br><br>SEC. 16. <i>Use of Marks.</i> - When a protected variety is offered
                for sale or marketed, it may be associated with a trademark, trade name or other similar indication with
                a registered denomination. If such an indication is so associated, the denomination must nevertheless be
                easily recognizable.<br><br><br>

                plant variety protection and obtain a Certificate of Plant Variety Protection upon compliance with the
                requirements of this Act.<br><br>SEC. 18.<i> Co-ownership of the Right.</i> - If two (2) or more persons
                contribute to the development of a new plant variety, all of them shall be named in the Certificate of

                belong to the employer, unless there is a written stipulation to the contrary.<br><br>SEC. 20.<i> First
                    to File Rule.</i> - If two (2) or more persons develop a new plant variety separately and
                independently of each other, the Certificate of Plant Variety Protection shall belong to the person who
                files the application first. In case two (2) or more persons file an application for the same plant

                Filipino citizens, shall be considered as filed locally as of the date of filing of the foreign
