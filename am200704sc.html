                    to COVID-19, as directed by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and

                <p>SECTION 5. <u>Legal Effect and Enforceability</u>. &#8212; Any notarial act performed through the use

                <p> SECTION 1. <u>Place of Remote Notarization</u>. &#8212; All notarial acts under these Rules shall be
                    performed by the notary public within the territorial jurisdiction of the court which issued the

                    must be located within the territorial jurisdiction of the notary public's commission during the
                    videoconference required in Rules II (in case of acknowledgment), III (in case of affirmation, oath,
                    or jurat), IV (in cases where the signatures of witnesses appear in the instrument or document), and
                    V (in cases where a thumbmark or other mark is affixed in lieu of a signature or when the notary
                    public signs on behalf of the principal) of these Rules.</p>

                    take a photograph or a screenshot of the videoconference clearly showing all parties who

                    holding the instrument or document to make the first page of the notarized document visible and
                    identifiable as such. The photograph or screenshot must bear a time and date stamp which accurately
                    reflects the time and date when the videoconference was conducted. A physical copy of this
                    photograph or screenshot must be produced and attached to the notarial register in the manner set

                    of the personal appearance of the principal/s and/or witnesses before the notary public and shall

                    Notarial Rules, the Notarial Register must include an entry indicating that the notarial act was
                    performed through videoconference as required by these Rules and specifying the particular
                    videoconferencing facility used by the parties therein.</p>
                <p> SECTION 4. <u>Entry of Notarial Act</u>. &#8212; The notary shall retain two (2) copies of the
                    instrument or document on which he or she performed a notarial act pursuant to these Rules. The
                    notary public shall attach to these copies the competent evidence of identity provided by the
                    parties and the witnesses and the photographs or screenshots required under Section 2, Rule VIII of
                    these Rules. The competent evidence of identity and photographs or screenshots shall be properly
                    marked with the document number and page number of the relevant entry. The first set of copies shall
                    be attached as annexes to the Notarial Register and form part of the entries corresponding to the
                    notarial act to which they pertain. The remaining set shall be kept by the notary public for his or
                    her records.</p>
                <p> SECTION 5. <u>Additional Matters in Notarial Certificate</u>. &#8212; In addition to the matters set
