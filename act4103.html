            <div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in
                Legislature assembled and by the authority of the same</i>:<br><br>SECTION 1. Hereafter, in imposing a
                prison sentence for an offense punished by acts of the Philippine Legislature, otherwise than by the
                Revised Penal Code, the court shall order the accused to be imprisoned for a minimum term, which shall
                not be less than the minimum term of imprisonment provided by law for the offense, and for a maximum
                term which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by law; and where the offense is punished by the Revised
                Penal Code, or amendments thereto, the court shall sentence the accused to such maximum as may, in view
                of attending circumstances, be properly imposed under the present rules of the said Code, and to a
                minimum which shall not be less than the minimum imprisonment period of the penalty next lower to that
                prescribed by said Code for the offense. Except as provided in section two hereof, any person who shall
                have been so convicted and sentenced and shall have served the minimum sentence imposed hereunder, may
                be released on parole in accordance with the provisions of this Act.<br><br>SEC. 2. This Act shall not
                apply to persons convicted of offenses punished with death penalty or life imprisonment; to those
                convicted of treason, conspiracy or proposal to commit treason; to those convicted of misprision of
                treason, sedition or espionage; to those convicted of piracy; to those who are habitual delinquents; to
                those who shall have escaped from confinement or evaded sentence; to those who having been granted
                conditional pardon by the Chief Executive shall have violated the terms thereof; to those whose maximum
                term of imprisonment does not exceed one year; nor to those already sentenced by final judgment at the
                time of approval of this Act except as provided in section five hereof.<br><br>SEC. 3. There is hereby
                created a Board of Indeterminate Sentence to be composed of the Secretary of Justice, who shall be its
                chairman, and four members to be appointed by the Governor-General, with the advice and consent of the
                Philippine Senate, upon this Act taking effect, and thereafter at the beginning of each Legislature: <i>Provided</i>,
                That one member of the Board shall be a trained sociologist, one a clergyman or educator, one
                psychiatrist unless a trained psychiatrist be employed by the Board, and the other members shall be
                persons qualified for such work by training or experience. At least one member of the Board shall be a
                woman. The members of the Board shall be subject to removal at the will of the Governor-General, and in
                case of any vacancy in the membership of the Board, a successor may be appointed to serve only for the
                unexpired portion of the term of the respective member.<br><br>SEC. 4. The Board shall adopt rules and
                regulations for its meetings and procedure. Each member shall be entitled to receive as compensation ten
                pesos for each meeting, not exceeding one thousand pesos annually, notwithstanding the provisions of
                section two hundred and fifty-nine of the Revised Administrative Code, and in addition thereto actual
                and necessary traveling expenses in the performance of duties.<br><br>SEC. 5. It shall be the duty of
                the Board of Indeterminate Sentence to look into the physical, mental and moral record of the prisoners
                who shall be eligible to parole and to determine the proper time of release of such prisoners. Whenever
                any prisoner shall have served the minimum penalty imposed on him, and it shall appear to the Board of
                Indeterminate Sentence, from the reports of the prisoner's work and conduct which may be received in
                accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed, and from the study and investigation made by the
                Board itself, that such prisoner is fitted by his training for release, that there is a reasonable
                probability that such prisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that such
                release will not be incompatible with the welfare of society, and Board of Indeterminate Sentence may,
                in its discretion, and in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted hereunder, authorize the
                release of such prisoner on parole, upon such terms and conditions as are herein prescribed and as may
                be prescribed by the Board. The said Board of Indeterminate Sentence shall also examine the records and
                status of prisoners who shall have been convicted of any offense other than those named in section two
                hereof, and been sentenced for more than one year by final judgment prior to the date on which this Act
                shall take effect, and shall make recommendations in all such cases to the Governor-General with regard
                to the parole of such prisoners as they shall deem qualified for parole as herein provided, after they
                shall have served a period of imprisonment not less than the minimum period for which they might have
                been sentenced under this Act for the same offense.<br><br>SEC. 6. Every prisoner released from
                confinement on parole by virtue of this Act shall, at such manner as may be required by the conditions
                of his parole, as may be designated by the said Board for such purpose, report personally to such
                government officials or other parole officers hereafter, appointed by the Board of Indeterminate
                Sentence for a period of surveillance equivalent to the remaining portion of the maximum sentence
                imposed upon him or until final release and discharge by the Board of Indeterminate Sentence as herein
                provided. The officials so designated shall keep such records and make such reports and perform such
                other duties hereunder as may be required by said Board. The limits of residence of such paroled
                prisoner during his parole may be fixed and from time to time changed by the said Board in its
                discretion. If during the period of surveillance such paroled prisoner shall show himself to be a
                law-abiding citizen and shall not violate any of the laws of the Philippine Islands, the Board of
                Indeterminate Sentence may issue a final certificate of release in his favor, which shall entitle him to
                final release and discharge.<br><br>SEC. 7. The Board shall file with the court which passed judgment on
                the case, and with the Chief of Constabulary, a certified copy of each order of conditional or final
                release and discharge issued in accordance with the provisions of the next preceding two
                sections.<br><br>SEC. 8. Any prisoner released on parole from confinement by virtue of this Act who
                shall violate any of the conditions of his parole, or shall violate any law of the Philippine Islands
                during the period of surveillance and be convicted thereof by a competent court, shall be subject to
                re-arrest and confinement, and shall serve the remaining unexpired portion of the maximum sentence for
                which he was originally committed to prison, unless the Board of Indeterminate Sentence shall in its
                discretion grant a new parole to the said prisoner. In carrying out the provisions of this section,
                there shall be followed, as far as might be applicable, the procedure prescribed in sections four and
                five of Act Numbered Fifteen hundred and twenty-four.<br><br>SEC. 9. Nothing in this Act shall be
                construed to impair or interfere with the powers of the Governor-General as set forth in section
                sixty-four (<i>i</i>) of the Revised Administrative Code or the Act of Congress approved August
                twenty-nine, nineteen hundred and sixteen entitled "An Act to declare the purpose of the people of the
                United States, as to the future political status of the people of the Philippine Islands, and to provide
                a more autonomous government for those Islands."<br><br>SEC. 10. Whenever any prisoner shall be released
                on parole hereunder he shall be entitled to receive the benefits provided in section one thousand seven
                hundred and fifty-one of the Revised Administrative Code.<br><br>SEC. 11. The sum of twenty-five
                thousand pesos is hereby appropriated out of any funds in the Insular Treasury, not otherwise
                appropriated, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act, to be disbursed by the
                Secretary of Justice.<br><br>SEC. 12. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.<br><br>Approved,
                December 5, 1933.
