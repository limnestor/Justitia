            <p align="center"><strong>A DECREE INSTITUTING A WATER CODE, THEREBY REVISING AND CONSOLIDATING THE LAWS GOVERNING THE OWNERSHIP, APPROPRIATION, UTILIZATION, EXPLOITATION, DEVELOPMENT, CONSERVATION AND PROTECTION OF WATER RESOURCES</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">WHEREAS, Article XIV, Section 8 of the New Constitution of the Philippines provides, inter alia, that all waters of the Philippines belong to the State;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">WHEREAS, existing water legislations are piece-meal and inadequate to cope with increasing scarcity of water and changing patterns of water use;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">WHEREAS, there is a need for a Water Code based on rational concepts of integrated and multipurpose management of water resources and sufficiently flexible to adequately meet future developments;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">WHEREAS, water is vital to national development and it has become increasingly necessary for government to intervene actively in improving the management of water resources;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers in me vested by the Constitution, do hereby order and decree the enactment of the Water Code of the Philippines of 1976, as follows:</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Beneficial use of water is the utilization of water in the right amount during the period that the water is needed for producing the benefits for which the water is appropriated.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 21. Standards of beneficial use shall be prescribed by the Council for the appropriator of water for different purposes and conditions, and the use of waters which are appropriated shall be measured and controlled in accordance therewith.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 22. Between two or more appropriators of water from the same sources of supply, priority in time of appropriation shall give the better right, except that in times of emergency the use of water for domestic and municipal purposes shall have a better right over all other uses; Provided, That where water shortage is recurrent and the appropriator for municipal use has a lower priority in time of appropriation, then it shall be his duty to find an alternative source of supply in accordance with conditions prescribed by the Council.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 23. Priorities may be altered on grounds of greater beneficial use, multi-purpose use, and other similar grounds after due notice and hearing, subject to payment of compensation is proper cases.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 24. A water right shall be exercised in such a manner that the rights of third persons or of other appropriators are not prejudiced thereby.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 25. A holder of a water permit may demand the establishment of easements necessary for the construction and maintenance of the works and facilities needed for the beneficial use of the waters to be appropriated subject to the requirements of just compensation and to the following conditions:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">a. That he is the owner, lessee, mortgagee or one having real right over the land upon which he proposes to use water; and</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">b. That the proposed easement is the most convenient and the least onerous to the servient estate.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Easements relating to the appropriation and use of waters may be modified by agreement of the contracting parties provided the same is not contrary to law or prejudicial to third persons.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 28. Water permits shall continue to be valid as long as water is beneficially used; however, it may be suspended on the grounds of non-compliance with approved plans and specifications or schedules of water distribution; use of water for a purpose other than that for which it was granted; non-payment of water charges; wastage; failure to keep records of water diversion, when required; and violation of any term or condition of any permit or of rules and regulations promulgated by the Council.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Temporary permits may be issued for the appropriation and use of water for short periods under special circumstances.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 29. Water permits may be revoked after due notice and hearing on grounds of non-use; gross violation of the conditions imposed in the permit; unauthorized sale of water; willful failure or refusal to comply with rules and regulations or any lawful order; pollution, public nuisance or acts detrimental to public health and safety; when the appropriator is found to be disqualified under the law to exploit and develop natural resources of the Philippines; when, in the case of irrigation, the land is converted to non-agricultural purposes; and other similar grounds.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 30. All water permits are subject to modification or cancellation by the Council, after due notice and hearing, in favor of a project of greater beneficial use or for multi-purpose development, and a water permittee who suffers thereby shall be duly compensated by the entity or person in whose favor the cancellation was made.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>CHAPTER IV</strong></p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Utilization of Waters</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 31. Preference in the development of water resources shall consider security of the State, multiple use, beneficial effects, adverse effects and costs of development.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 32. The utilization of subterranean or ground water shall be coordinated with that of surface waters such as rivers, streams, springs and lakes, so that a superior right in one is not adversely affected by an inferior right in the other.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">For this purpose the Council shall promulgate rules and regulations and declare the existence of control areas for the coordinated development, protection, and utilization of subterranean or ground water and surface waters.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Control area is an area of land where subterranean or ground water and surface water are so interrelated that withdrawal and use in one similarly affects the other. The boundary of a control area may be altered from time to time, as circumstances warrant.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 33. Water contained in open canals, aqueducts or reservoirs of private persons may be used by any person for domestic purpose or for watering plants as long as the water is withdrawn by manual methods without checking the stream or damaging the canal, aqueduct or reservoir; Provided, That this right may be restricted by the owner should it result in loss or injury to him.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 34. A water permittee or appropriator may use any watercourse to convey water to another point in the watercourse for the purpose stated in a permit and such water may be diverted or recaptured at that point by said permittee in the same amount less allowance for normal losses in transit.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 35. Works for the storage, diversion, distribution and utilization of water resources shall contain adequate provision for the prevention and control of diseases that may be induced or spread by such works when required by the Council.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE 36. When the reuse of waste water is feasible, it shall be limited as much as possible, to such uses other than direct human consumption.
