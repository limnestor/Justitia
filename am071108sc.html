The legal brief shall state the applicable law and the relevant jurisprudence and the legal arguments in support of a party’s position in the case.</p>
                <p align="justify">f. &quot;Verification&quot; shall mean a certification under oath by a party or a person who has authority to act for a party that he has read the pleading/motion, and that he certifies to the truth of the facts stated therein on the basis of his own personal knowledge or authentic documents in his possession.

            <p align="center"><b>RULE 2: STATEMENT OF POLICIES</b></p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Rule 2.1.</b> <i>General policies</i>. - It is the policy of the State to actively promote the use of various modes of ADR and to respect party autonomy or the freedom of the parties to make their own arrangements in the resolution of disputes with the greatest cooperation of and the least intervention from the courts. To this end, the objectives of the Special ADR Rules are to encourage and promote the use of ADR, particularly arbitration and mediation, as an important means to achieve speedy and efficient resolution of disputes, impartial justice, curb a litigious culture and to de-clog court dockets.</p>
            <p align="justify">The court shall exercise the power of judicial review as provided by these Special ADR Rules. Courts shall intervene only in the cases allowed by law or these Special ADR Rules.  </p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Rule 2.2.</b> <i>Policy on arbitration</i>.- (A) Where the parties have agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration, courts shall refer the parties to arbitration pursuant to Republic Act No. 9285 bearing in mind that such arbitration agreement is the law between the parties and that they are expected to abide by it in good faith.  Further, the courts shall not refuse to refer parties to arbitration for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: </p>
            <dir>
                <p align="justify">a. The referral tends to oust a court of its jurisdiction; </p>
                <p align="justify">b. The court is in a better position to resolve the dispute subject of arbitration; </p>
                <p align="justify">c. The referral would result in multiplicity of suits; </p>
                <p align="justify">d. The arbitration proceeding has not commenced; </p>
                <p align="justify">e. The place of arbitration is in a foreign country; </p>
                <p align="justify">f. One or more of the issues are legal and one or more of the arbitrators are not lawyers;</p>
                <p align="justify">g. One or more of the arbitrators are not Philippine nationals; or</p>
                <p align="justify">h. One or more of the arbitrators are alleged not to possess the required qualification under the arbitration agreement or law.</p>
            </dir>
            <p align="justify">(B) Where court intervention is allowed under ADR Laws or the Special ADR Rules, courts shall not refuse to grant relief, as provided herein, for any of the following reasons: </p>
            <dir>
                <p align="justify">a. Prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, the court finds that the principal action is the subject of an arbitration agreement; or </p>
                <p align="justify">b. The principal action is already pending before an arbitral tribunal.</p>
            </dir>
            <p align="justify">The Special ADR Rules recognize the principle of competence-competence, which means that the arbitral tribunal may initially rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement or any condition precedent to the filing of a request for arbitration.  </p>
            <p align="justify">The Special ADR Rules recognize the principle of separability of the arbitration clause, which means that said clause shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract of which it forms part. A decision that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. </p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Rule 2.3.</b>  <i>Rules governing arbitral proceedings</i>. - The parties are free to agree on the procedure to be followed in the conduct of arbitral proceedings. Failing such agreement, the arbitral tribunal may conduct arbitration in the manner it considers appropriate. </p>

            <p align="center"><b>RULE A: GUIDELINES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES RELATED TO ARBITRATION OF LOANS SECURED BY COLLATERAL</p>
            <p align="justify">Rule A.1.</b> <i>Applicability of an arbitration agreement in a contract of loan applies to the accessory contract securing the loan</i>. - An arbitration agreement in a contract of loan extends to and covers the accessory contract securing the loan such as a pledge or a mortgage executed by the borrower in favor of the lender under that contract of loan.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Rule A.2.</b> <i>Foreclosure of pledge or extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgage not precluded by arbitration</i>. - The commencement of the arbitral proceeding under the contract of loan containing an arbitration agreement shall not preclude the lender from availing himself of the right to obtain satisfaction of the loan under the accessory contract by foreclosure of the thing pledged or by extra-judicial foreclosure of the collateral under the real estate mortgage in accordance with Act No. 3135.</p>
            <p align="justify">The lender may likewise institute foreclosure proceedings against the collateral securing the loan prior to the commencement of the arbitral proceeding.</p>
            <p align="justify">By agreeing to refer any dispute under the contract of loan to arbitration, the lender who is secured by an accessory contract of real estate mortgage shall be deemed to have waived his right to obtain satisfaction of the loan by judicial foreclosure. </p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Rule A.3.</b> <i>Remedy of the borrower against an action taken by the lender against the collateral before the constitution of the arbitral tribunal</i>. - The borrower providing security for the payment of his loan who is aggrieved by the action taken by the lender against the collateral securing the loan may, if such action against the collateral is taken before the arbitral tribunal is constituted, apply with the appropriate court for interim relief against any such action of the lender. Such interim relief may be obtained only in a special proceeding for that purpose, against the action taken by the lender against the collateral, pending the constitution of the arbitral tribunal. Any determination made by the court in that special proceeding pertaining to the merits of the controversy, including the right of the lender to proceed against the collateral, shall be only provisional in nature.</p>
            <p align="justify">After the arbitral tribunal is constituted, the court shall stay its proceedings and defer to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal over the entire controversy including any question regarding the right of the lender to proceed against the collateral.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Rule A.4.</b> <i>Remedy of borrower against action taken by the lender against the collateral after the arbitral tribunal has been constituted</i>. - After the arbitral tribunal is constituted, the borrower providing security for the payment of his loan who is aggrieved by the action taken by the lender against the collateral securing the loan may apply to the arbitral tribunal for relief, including a claim for damages, against such action of the lender. An application to the court may also be made by the borrower against any action taken by the lender against the collateral securing the loan but only if the arbitral tribunal cannot act effectively to prevent an irreparable injury to the rights of such borrower during the pendency of the arbitral proceeding.</p>
            <p align="justify">An arbitration agreement in a contract of loan precludes the borrower therein providing security for the loan from filing and/or proceeding with any action in court to prevent the lender from foreclosing the pledge or extra-judicially foreclosing the mortgage. If any such action is filed in court, the lender shall have the right provided in the Special ADR Rules to have such action stayed on account of the arbitration agreement.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Rule A.5.</b> <i>Relief that may be granted by the arbitral tribunal</i>. - The arbitral tribunal, in aid of the arbitral proceeding before it, may upon submission of adequate security, suspend or enjoin the lender from proceeding against the collateral securing the loan pending final determination by the arbitral tribunal of the dispute brought to it for decision under such contract of loan.</p>
            <p align="justify">The arbitral tribunal shall have the authority to resolve the issue of the validity of the foreclosure of the thing pledged or of the extrajudicial foreclosure of the collateral under the real estate mortgage if the same has not yet been foreclosed or confirm the validity of such foreclosure if made before the rendition of the arbitral award and had not been enjoined.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Rule A.6.</b> <i>Arbitration involving a third-party provider of security</i>. - An arbitration agreement contained in a contract of loan between the lender and the borrower extends to and covers an accessory contract securing the loan, such as a pledge, mortgage, guaranty or suretyship, executed by a person other than the borrower only if such third-party securing the loan has agreed in the accessory contract, either directly or by reference, to be bound by such arbitration agreement.</p>
            <p align="justify">Unless otherwise expressly agreed upon by the third-party securing the loan, his agreement to be bound by the arbitration agreement in the contract of loan shall pertain to disputes arising from or in connection with the relationship between the lender and the borrower as well as the relationship between the lender and such third-party including the right of the lender to proceed against the collateral securing the loan, but shall exclude disputes pertaining to the relationship exclusively between the borrower and the provider of security such as that involving a claim by the provider of security for indemnification against the borrower.</p>
            <p align="justify">In this multi-party arbitration among the lender, the borrower and the third party securing the loan, the parties may agree to submit to arbitration before a sole arbitrator or a panel of three arbitrators to be appointed either by an Appointing Authority designated by the parties in the arbitration agreement or by a default Appointing Authority under the law.</p>
            <p align="justify">In default of an agreement on the manner of appointing arbitrators or of constituting the arbitral tribunal in such multi-party arbitration, the dispute shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators to be designated by the Appointing Authority under the law. But even in default of an agreement on the manner of appointing an arbitrator or constituting an arbitral tribunal in a multi-party arbitration, if the borrower and the third party securing the loan agree to designate a common arbitrator, arbitration shall be decided by a panel of three arbitrators: one to be designated by the lender; the other to be designated jointly by the borrower and the provider of security who have agreed to designate the same arbitrator; and a third arbitrator who shall serve as the chairperson of the arbitral panel to be designated by the two party-designated arbitrators.</p>
