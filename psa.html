                <p align="justify"><b>Section 2.</b> There is created under the Department of Justice a commission which shall be designated and known as the Public Service Commission, composed of one Public Service Commissioner and five Associate Commissioners, and which shall be vested with the powers and duties hereafter specified. Whenever the word "Commission" is used in this Act, it shall be held to mean the Public Service Commission, and whenever the word "Commissioner" is used in this Act it shall be held to mean the Public Service Commissioner or anyone of the Associate Commissioners. The Public Service Commissioner and the Associate Public Service Commissioners shall be natural born citizens and residents of the Philippines, not under thirty years of age; members of the Bar of the Philippines, with at least five years of law practice or five years of employment in the government service requiring a lawyer's diploma; and shall be appointed by the President of the Philippines, with the consent of the Commission on Appointments of the Congress of the Philippines: Provided, however, That the present Commissioner and the personnel of the Commission shall continue in office without the necessity of re-appointment. The Commissioners shall have the rank and privilege of retirement of Judges of the Courts of First Instance. (As amended by Republic Act Nos. 178 and 2677) </p>

In case of the absence, for any reason, of the Public Service Commissioner, the Associate Commissioner with seniority of appointment shall act as Commissioner. If on account of absence, illness, or incapacity of any of three Commissioners, or whenever by reason of temporary disability of any Commissioner or of a vacancy occurring therein, the requisite number of Commissioners necessary to render a decision or issue an order in any case is not present, or in the event of a tie vote among the Commissioners, the Secretary of Justice may designate such number of Judges of the Courts of First Instance, or such number of attorneys of the legal division of the Commission, as may be necessary to sit temporarily as Commissioners in the Public Service Commission. </p>

                <p align="justify">When the exigency of the service so requires and with the approval of the Secretary of Justice, and subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act Numbered Two hundred forty-six, as amended, funds may be set aside from the appropriations provided for the Commission and/or from the fees collected under Section forty of this Act to defray the expenses to be incurred by the Public Service Commissioner or any of the Associate Commissioners, officers or employees of the Commission to be designated by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of Justice, in the study of modern trends in supervision and regulation of public services.

Any franchise or certificate necessary for the operation of a public service shall be granted by Congress unless otherwise previously delegated by law to the relevant Administrative Agencies.</p>

                <p align="justify">Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted as a requirement for legislative franchise where the law does not require any. No other person shall be deemed a public utility unless otherwise subsequently provided by law.
                <p align="justify">(e) Upon the recommendation of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), the President may recommend to Congress the classification of a public service as a public utility on the basis of the following criteria:
                <dir>
                    <p align="justify">(1) The person or juridical entity regularly supplies and transmits and distributes to the public through a network a commodity or service of public consequence;</p>
                    <p align="justify">(2) The commodity or service is a natural monopoly that needs to be regulated when the common good so requires. For this purpose, natural monopoly exists when the market demand for a commodity or service can be supplied by a single entity at a lower cost that by two or more entities;</p>
                    <p align="justify">(3) The commodity or service is necessary for the maintenance of life and occupation of the public; and</p>
                    <p align="justify">(4) The commodity or service is obligated to provide adequate service to the public on demand.</p>
                </dir>

                <p align="justify">All public services, including those classified as public utilities under this Act, shall continue to be regulated and supervised by the relevant Administrative Agencies under existing laws.</p>
                <p align="justify">A public service which is not classified as a public utility under this Act shall be considered a business affected with public interest for purposes of Sections 17 and 18 of Article XII of the Constitution.</p>
                <p align="justify">Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, nationality requirements shall not be imposed by the relevant Administrative Agencies on any public service not classified as a public utility.</p>
                <p align="justify">The NEDA shall provide periodic advice to Administrative Agencies on the proper application of the constitutional and other legal restrictions to local and foreign-owned subcontractors, without putting operational resiliency at risk.</p>

                <p align="justify"><b>Section 14.</b> The following are exempted from the provisions of the preceding section: </p>
                <dir>
                    <p align="justify">(a) Warehouses; </p>
                    <p align="justify">(b) Vehicles drawn by animals and bancas moved by oar or sail, and tugboats and lighters; </p>
                    <p align="justify">(c) Airships within the Philippines except as regards the fixing of their maximum rates on freight and passengers; </p>
                    <p align="justify">(d) Radio companies except with respect to the fixing of rates; </p>
                    <p align="justify">(e) Public services owned or operated by any instrumentality of the National Government or by any government-owned or controlled corporation, except with respect to the fixing of rates. (As amended by Com. Act 454, RA No. 2031, and RA No. 2677 ) </p>
                </dir>
                <p align="justify"><b>Section 15.</b> With the exception of those enumerated in the preceding section, no public service shall operate in the Philippines without possessing a valid and subsisting certificate from the Public Service Commission known as "certificate of public convenience," or "certificate of public convenience and necessity," as the case may be, to the effect that the operation of said service and the authorization to do business will promote the public interests in a proper and suitable manner. </p>
                <p align="justify">The Commission shall prescribe as a condition for the issuance of the certificate or authorization provided in the preceding paragraph that the service can be acquired by the Republic of the Philippines or any instrumentality thereof, or the issuing local government unit, upon payment of just compensation in accordance with the pertinent laws, rules, and regulations on expropriation; and likewise, that the certificate or authorization shall be valid only for a definite period of time and that the violation of any of theses conditions shall, after hearing, result in the immediate cancellation of the certificate or authorization without the necessity of any express action on the part of the issuing authority.</p>
                <p align="justify">In estimating the depreciation, the effect of the use of the equipment, its actual condition, the age of the model, or other circumstances affecting its value in the market shall be taken into consideration. </p>
                <p align="justify">The foregoing is likewise applicable to any extension or amendment of certificates actually in force and to those which may hereafter be issued, to permit to modify itineraries and time schedules of public services, and to authorizations to renew and increase equipment and properties.</p>
                <p align="justify"><b>Section 16.</b> Proceedings of the Commission, upon notice and hearing. - The Commission shall have the power, upon notice and hearing in accordance with the rules and provisions of this Act:</p>
                <dir>
                    <p align="justify">(a) To issue certificates authorizing the operation of public service within the Philippines whenever the Commission finds that the operation of the public service proposed and the authorization to do business will promote the public interest in a proper and suitable manner: Provided, That any certificate authorizing the operation, management or control of a public service shall only be issued to corporations, partnerships, associations or joint stock companies that are constituted and organized under the laws of the Philippines.</p>
                    <p align="justify">(b) To approve, subject to constitutional limitations any franchise or privilege granted under the provisions of Act No. Six Hundred and Sixty-seven, as amended by Act No. One Thousand and twenty-two, by any political subdivision of the Philippines when, in the judgment of the Commission, such franchise or privilege will properly conserve the public interests, and the Commission shall in so approving impose such conditions as to construction, equipment, maintenance, service, or operation as the public interests and convenience may reasonably require, and to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity when such is required or provided by any law or franchise. </p>
                    <p align="justify">(c) To fix and determine the fair and reasonable individual or joint rates, tolls, charges, classifications, tariffs or schedules thereof, as well as commutation, mileage, kilometrage, and other special rates which shall be imposed, observed, and followed thereafter by any public service when the public interest so requires: Provided, That the Commission may, in its discretion, approve rates proposed by public services provisionally and without necessity of any hearing; but it shall call a hearing thereon within fifteen (15) days, thereafter, upon publication and notice to the affected parties in the territory affected, to ratify its prior provisional approval or change, modify or later the approved rate based on public interest: Provided, further, That in case the public service equipment of an operator is used principally or secondarily for the promotion of a private business, the net profits of said private business shall be considered in relation with the public service of such operator for the purpose of fixing the rates: Provided, finally, That when the public interest requires, the Administrative Agency may establish and enforce a methodology for setting rates, taking into account all relevant considerations, including the efficiency of the regulated public service. The rates must be such as to allow the recovery of prudent and efficient costs and a reasonable rate of return to enable the public service to operate viably and efficiently. The Administrative Agency may adopt alternative forms consistent with internationally accepted rate-setting methodology.

                    <p align="justify">(3) One public service corporation cannot assume the name and be substituted in the place of another public service corporation. </p>
                    <p align="justify">(4) A legal representative of the estate of a deceased applicant may be substituted for the latter. If the right consists in the prosecution of unfinished proceedings upon an application for a certificate of public convenience of the deceased before the Public service Commission, it is but logical that the legal representative be empowered and entitled in behalf of the estate to make the right effective in that proceeding. </p>
                    <p align="justify">(5) One who has been granted a legislative franchise to operate an ice plant, although not yet an operator of such public utility, has sufficient interest or personality either to oppose an established operator's application for an increase in the capacity of his existing plant, or to ask for a joint hearing of said application and the grantee's own application for the issuance of a certificate of public convenience in order to operate under such franchise. </p>
                    <p align="justify">(6) The fact that a party is the lessee of a line does not bar him from applying for a certificate of its own in the same line. Even in cases where the owner of a certificate has sold it subject to the condition that he would not apply for a similar service on the same line sold by him, it has been held that such an argument does not bar the seller from applying and that the Public Service Commission, if it finds that there is public need for the new service applied for, may properly grant the certificate requested. In other words the primary consideration is a finding by the Commission that public interest and convenience require a given service and that parties may not by agreement deprive the Commission of its power. </p>
                    <p align="justify">(7) A case involving the grant of a Certificate of Public Convenience to the respondent becomes moot and academic where the respondent ceases to be a bus operator, and it should be dismissed. </p>
