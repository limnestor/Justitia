                the clerk of court. A signatory may waive the transmittal of the duplicate original

                The failure to rectify material discrepancies or to respond to a signatory's
                notice thereof shall be a ground for nonrenewal of a notarial commission and
                temporary disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public.
            </p>
            <p>
                The transmittal to a clerk of court of an unrectified duplicate original or
                one which the notary public has been notified of material discrepancies shall be a
                ground for revocation of the notarial commission and permanent disqualification
                from being commissioner as a notary public.
