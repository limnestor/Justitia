            <div align="justify">WHEREAS, Republic Act No. 10175, otherwise known as the "Cybercrime Prevention Act of
                2012," defines acts constituting cybercrime offenses; prescribes penalties therefor; and provides
                procedures facilitating their detection, investigation, and prosecution; <p>WHEREAS, the detection,
                    investigation, and prosecution of cybercrime offenses necessitate a rule of procedure therefor,
                    especially for the application, issuance, and implementation of court warrants technically-suited to
                    the nature of cybercrime offenses; </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5 (5), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, the Supreme Court is
                    vested with the power to promulgate rules concerning the pleading, practice, and procedure in all
                    courts; </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, through Memorandum Order No. 11-17 dated February 2, 2017, tasked the
                    Sub-Committee on Commercial Courts to draft the rules of procedure "that shall respond to the
                    technical requirements of cybercrime prosecution and aid the cybercrime courts in the exercise of
                    their special jurisdiction" through a Technical Working Group created for the purpose; </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, through A.M. No. 17-11-03-SC dated July 3, 2018, approved the Rule on
                    Cybercrime Warrants. </p>
                <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE</strong>, acting on the recommendation of the Sub-Committee on Commercial
                    Courts, the Court resolved to APPROVE the "<strong>Rule on Cybercrime Warrants</strong>." </p>
                <p> The Rule on Cybercrime Warrants shall take effect on August 15, 2018 following its publication in
                    the Official Gazette or in two newspapers of national circulation not later than July 30, 2018. <br>

                    Warrants, Justice Callejo pointed out that the construction of the phrase "used as evidence" can be
                    in reference to the offense for which the warrant was applied or to a different offense altogether.
                    The latter instance may fall under the doctrine of "independent source of evidence", which allows
                    for the introduction of evidence obtained by a separate and distinct method, an independent source;
                    cited in Bloom, Robert M., <i>Inevitable Discovery: An Exception beyond the Fruits</i> (1992), 20

                    searched, seized &amp; examined "computer data" under Sec. 15 of RA 10175. The described types of
                    information, however, being essentially electronically stored information (ESI) cannot easily lend
                    themselves to "destruction", thus, the use of the words remove and delete in tandem with "destroy".
                    The word "destroy" cannot be omitted because RA 10175 employs it. It may be inappropriate for a rule
