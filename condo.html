Unless otherwise provided for by the declaration of restrictions, the management body, provided for herein, may acquire and hold, for the benefit of the condominium owners, tangible and intangible personal property and may dispose of the same by sale or otherwise; and the beneficial interest in such personal property shall owned by the condominium owners in the same proton as their respective interests in the common areas.&nbsp; A transfer of a condominium shall transfer to the transferee ownership of the transferor's beneficial interest in such personal property.<br><br>SEC. 23. Where, in an action for partition of a condominium project or for the dissolution of condominium corporation on the ground that the project or a material part thereof has been condemned or expropriated, the Court finds that the conditions provided for in this Act or in declaration of restrictions have not been met, the Court may decree a reorganization of the project, declaring which portion or portions of the project shall continue as a condominium project, the owners thereof and the respective rights of said remaining owners and the just compensation, if any, that a condominium owns may be entitled to due to deprivation of his property.&nbsp; Upon receipt of a copy of the decree, the Register Deeds shall enter and annotate the same on the pertinent certificate of title.<br><br>SEC. 24. Any deed, declaration or plan for a condominium project shall be liberally construed to facilitate the operation of the project, and its provisions shall be presumed to be independent and severable.<br><br>SEC. 25. Whenever real property has been divided into condominiums, each condominium separately owned shall be separately assessed, for purposes of real property taxation and other tax purposes to the owners thereof and the tax on each such condominium shall constitute a lien solely thereon.<br><br>SEC. 26. All Acts or parts of Acts in conflict or inconsistent with this Act are hereby amended insofar as condominiums and its incidents are concerned.<br><br>SEC. 27.
