        <p>General Provisions Regarding the Date of Enforcement and Application of the Provisions of this Code, and Regarding the Offenses, the Persons Liable and the Penalties</p>
        <p align="center">PRELIMINARY TITLE</p>
        <p align="center">Date of Effectiveness and Application of the Provisions of This Code</p>

        <p>ARTICLE 2.

        <p align="center">Felonies and Circumstances Which Affect Criminal Liability</p>
        <p align="center">CHAPTER ONE</p>
        <p align="center">Felonies</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 3. Definition. — Acts and omissions punishable by law are felonies (delitos).</p>
        <p>Felonies are committed not only by means of deceit (dolo) but also by means of fault (culpa).</p>
        <p>There is deceit when the act is performed with deliberate intent; and there is fault when the wrongful act results from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight, or lack of skill.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 4. Criminal Liability. — Criminal liability shall be incurred:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. By any person committing a felony (delito) although the wrongful act done be different from that which he intended.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. By any person performing an act which would be an offense against persons or property, were it not for the inherent impossibility of its accomplishment or on account of the employment of inadequate or ineffectual means.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 5. Duty of the Court in Connection with Acts Which Should Be Repressed but Which are Not Covered by the Law, and in Cases of Excessive Penalties. — Whenever a court has knowledge of any act which it may deem proper to repress and which is not punishable by law, it shall render the proper decision, and shall report to the Chief Executive, through the Department of Justice, the reasons which induce the court to believe that said act should be made the subject of penal legislation.</p>
        <p>In the same way the court shall submit to the Chief Executive, through the Department of Justice, such statement as may be deemed proper, without suspending the execution of the sentence, when a strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would result in the imposition of a clearly excessive penalty, taking into consideration the degree of malice and the injury caused by the offense.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 6. Consummated,, Frustrated, and Attempted Felonies. — Consummated felonies, as well as those which are frustrated and attempted, are punishable.</p>
        <p>A felony is consummated when all the elements necessary for its execution and accomplishment are present; and it is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts of execution which would produce the felony as a consequence but which, nevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator.</p>
        <p>There is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of a felony directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 7. When Light Felonies are Punishable. — Light felonies are punishable only when they have been consummated, with the exception of those committed against person or property.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 8. Conspiracy and Proposal to Commit Felony. — Conspiracy and proposal to commit felony are punishable only in the cases in which the law specially provides a penalty therefor.</p>
        <p>A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.</p>
        <p>There is proposal when the person who has decided to commit a felony proposes its execution to some other person or persons.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 9. Grave Felonies, Less Grave Felonies and Light Felonies. — Grave felonies are those to which the law attaches the capital punishment or penalties which in any of their periods are afflictive, in accordance with Article 25 of this Code.</p>
        <p>Less grave felonies are those which the law punishes with penalties which in their maximum period are correctional, in accordance with the abovementioned article.</p>
        <p>Light felonies are those infractions of law for the commission of which the penalty of arresto menor or a fine not exceeding Forty thousand pesos (P40,000) or both is provided.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 10. Offenses Not Subject to the Provisions of this Code. — Offenses which are or in the future may be punishable under special laws are not subject to the provisions of this Code. This Code shall be supplementary to such laws, unless the latter should specially provide the contrary.</p>

        <p>ARTICLE 15. Their Concept. — Alternative circumstances are those which must be taken into consideration as aggravating or mitigating according to the nature and effects of the crime and the other conditions attending its commission.

        <p align="center">Rules for the Application of Penalties with Regard to the Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances, and Habitual Delinquency</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 62. Effects of the attendance of mitigating or aggravating circumstances and of habitual delinquency. - Mitigating or aggravating circumstances and habitual delinquency shall be taken into account for the purpose of diminishing or increasing the penalty in conformity with the following rules:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Aggravating circumstances which in themselves constitute a crime specially punishable by law or which are included by the law in defining a crime and prescribing the penalty therefor shall not be taken into account for the purpose of increasing the penalty.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1(a). When in the commission of the crime, advantage was taken by the offender of his public position, the penalty to be imposed shall be in its maximum regardless of mitigating circumstances.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The maximum penalty shall be imposed if the offense was committed by any group who belongs to an organized/syndicated crime group.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">An organized/syndicated crime group means a group of two or more persons collaborating, confederating or mutually helping one another for purposes of gain in the commission of any crime.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. The same rule shall apply with respect to any aggravating circumstances inherent in the crime to such a degree that it must of necessity accompany the commission thereof.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Aggravating or mitigating circumstances which arise from the moral attributes of the offender, or from his private relations with the offended party, or from any other personal cause, shall only serve to aggravate or mitigate the liability of the principals, accomplices and accessories as to whom such circumstances are attendant.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. The circumstances which consist in the material execution of the act, or in the means employed to accomplish it, shall serve to aggravate or mitigate the liability of those persons only who had knowledge of them at the time of the execution of the act or their cooperation therein.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. Habitual delinquency shall have the following effects:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(a) Upon a third conviction the culprit shall be sentenced to the penalty provided by law for the last crime of which he be found guilty and to the additional penalty of prision correccional in its medium and maximum periods;</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(b) Upon a fourth conviction, the culprit shall be sentenced to the penalty provided for the last crime of which he be found guilty and to the additional penalty of prision mayor in its minimum and medium periods; and</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;">(c) Upon a fifth or additional conviction, the culprit shall be sentenced to the penalty provided for the last crime of which he be found guilty and to the additional penalty of prision mayor in its maximum period to reclusion temporal in its minimum period.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, the total of the two penalties to be imposed upon the offender, in conformity herewith, shall in no case exceed 30 years.</p>
        <p>For purposes of this article, a person shall be deemed to be a habitual delinquent, if within a period of ten years from the date of his release or last conviction of the crimes of serious or less serious physical injuries, robo, hurto, estafa or falsification, he is found guilty of any of said crimes a third time or oftener.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 63. Rules for the Application of Indivisible Penalties. — In all cases in which the law prescribes a single indivisible penalty, it shall be applied by the courts regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the deed.</p>
        <p>In all cases in which the law prescribes a penalty composed of two indivisible penalties, the following rules shall be observed in the application thereof:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. When in the commission of the deed there is present only one aggravating circumstance, the greater penalty shall be applied.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. When there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the lesser penalty shall be applied.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. When the commission of the act is attended by some mitigating circumstance and there is no aggravating circumstance, the lesser penalty shall be applied.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. When both mitigating and aggravating circumstances attended the commission of the act, the courts shall reasonably allow them to offset one another in consideration of their number and importance, for the purpose of applying the penalty in accordance with the preceding rules, according to the result of such compensation.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 64. Rules for the Application of Penalties Which Contain Three Periods. — In cases in which the penalties prescribed by law contain three periods, whether it be a single divisible penalty or composed of three different penalties, each one of which forms a period in accordance with the provisions of articles 76 and 77, the courts shall observe for the application of the penalty the following rules, according to whether there are or are not mitigating or aggravating circumstances:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. When there are neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances, they shall impose the penalty prescribed by law in its medium period.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. When only a mitigating circumstance is present in the commission of the act, they shall impose the penalty in its minimum period.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. When only an aggravating circumstance is present in the commission of the act, they shall impose the penalty in its maximum period.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. When both mitigating and aggravating circumstances are present, the court shall reasonably offset those of one class against the other according to their relative weight.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. When there are two or more mitigating circumstances and no aggravating circumstances are present, the court shall impose the penalty next lower to that prescribed by law, in the period that it may deem applicable, according to the number and nature of such circumstances.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. Whatever may be the number and nature of the aggravating circumstances, the courts shall not impose a greater penalty than that prescribed by law, in its maximum period.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. Within the limits of each period, the courts shall determine the extent of the penalty according to the number and nature of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the greater or lesser extent of the evil produced by the crime.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 65. Rule in Cases in Which the Penalty is Not Composed of Three Periods. — In cases in which the penalty prescribed by law is not composed of three periods, the courts shall apply the rules contained in the foregoing articles, dividing into three equal portions the time included in the penalty prescribed, and forming one period of each of the three portions.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 66. Imposition of Fines. — In imposing fines the courts may fix any amount within the limits established by law; in fixing the amount in each case attention shall be given, not only to the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, but more particularly to the wealth or means of the culprit.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 67. Penalty to Be Imposed When Not All the Requisites of Exemption of the Fourth Circumstance of Article 12 are Present.— When all the conditions required in circumstance number 4 of article 12 of this Code to exempt from criminal liability are not present, the penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period to prisión correccional in its minimum period shall be imposed upon the culprit if he shall have been guilty of a grave felony, and arresto mayor in its minimum and medium periods, if of a less grave felony.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 68. Penalty to Be Imposed Upon a Person Under Eighteen Years of Age. — When the offender is a minor under eighteen years and his case is one coming under the provisions of the paragraph next to the last of article 80 of this Code, the following rules shall be observed:</p>
        <s><a href="ra9344.html">
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Upon a person under fifteen but over nine years of age, who is not exempted from liability by reason of the court having declared that he acted with discernment, a discretionary penalty shall be imposed, but always lower by two degrees at least than that prescribed by law for the crime which he committed.</p>
        </a></s>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Upon a person over fifteen and under eighteen years of age the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law shall be imposed, but always in the proper period.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 69. Penalty to Be Imposed When the Crime Committed is Not Wholly Excusable. — A penalty lower by one or two degrees than that prescribed by law shall be imposed if the deed is not wholly excusable by reason of the lack of some of the conditions required to justify the same or to exempt from criminal liability in the several cases mentioned in articles 11 and 12, provided that the majority of such conditions be present. The courts shall impose the penalty in the period which may be deemed proper, in view of the number and nature of the conditions of exemption present or lacking.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 70. Successive service of sentences.—When the culprit has to serve two or more penalties, he shall serve them simultaneously if the nature of the penalties will so permit; otherwise, the following rules shall be observed:</p>
        <p>In the imposition of the penalties, the order of their respective severity shall be followed so that they may be executed successively or as nearly as may be possible, should a pardon have been granted as to the penalty or penalties first imposed, or should they have been served out.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of applying the provisions of the next preceding paragraph the respective severity of the penalties shall be determined in accordance with the following scale:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Death.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Reclusión perpetua.</p>

No other penalty to which he may be liable shall be inflicted after the sum total of those imposed equals the said maximum period.</p>
        <p>Such maximum period shall in no case exceed forty years.</p>
        <p>In applying the provisions of this rule the duration of ¦ perpetual penalties (pena perpetua) shall be computed at thirty years.</p>
        <p>ARTICLE 71.  Graduated scales.—In the cases in which the law prescribes a penalty lower or higher by one or more degrees than another given penalty, the rules prescribed in article 61 shall be observed in graduating such penalty.</p>

        <p>ARTICLE 80. Suspension of Sentence of Minor Delinquents. — Whenever a minor under eighteen years of age, of either sex, be accused of a crime, the court, after hearing the evidence in the proper proceedings, instead of pronouncing judgment, shall suspend all further proceedings and shall commit such minor to the custody or care of a public or private, benevolent or charitable institution, established under the law for the care, correction or education of orphaned, homeless, defective and delinquent children, or to the custody or care of any other responsible person in any other place subject to visitation and supervision by the Public Welfare Commissioner or any of his agents or representatives, if there be any, or otherwise by the superintendent of public schools or his representatives, subject to such conditions as are prescribed hereinbelow, until such minor shall have reached his majority or for such less period as the court may deem proper.</p>
        <p>The court, in committing said minor as provided above, shall take into consideration the religion of such minor, his parents or next of kin, in order to avoid his commitment to any private institution not under the control and supervision of the religious sect or denomination to which they belong.</p>

        <p>The suspension of the proceedings against a minor may be extended or shortened by the court on the recommendation of the Public Welfare Commissioner or his authorized representatives or agents, or the superintendent of public schools or his representatives, according as to whether the conduct of such minor has been good or not and whether he has complied with the conditions imposed upon him.
