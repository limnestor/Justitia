            <BR><BR>
            <div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner has appealed to us by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from
                the "Joint Order" issued by public respondents on June 18, 1997 in OMB-Adm. Case No. 0-95-0411 which
                granted the motion for reconsideration of and absolved private respondents from administrative charges
                for <i>inter alia</i> grave misconduct committed by him as then Assistant Regional Director, Region
                IV-A, Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).<br><br>
                <center><b>I</b></center>
                <br>It appears from the statement and counter-statement of facts of the parties that petitioner Teresita
                G. Fabian was the major stockholder and president of PROMAT Construction Development Corporation
                (PROMAT) which was engaged in the construction business. Private respondents Nestor V. Agustin was the
                incumbent District Engineering District (FMED) when he allegedly committed the offenses for which he was
                administratively charged in the Office in the office of the Ombudsman.<br><br>Promat participated in the
                bidding for government construction project including those under the FMED, and private respondent,
                reportedly taking advantage of his official position, inveigled petitioner into an amorous relationship.
                Their affair lasted for some time, in the course of which private respondents gifted PROMAT with public
                works contracts and interceded for it in problems concerning the same in his office.<br><br>Later,
                misunderstanding and unpleasant incidents developed between the parties and when petitioner tried to
                terminate their relationship, private respondent refused and resisted her attempts to do so to the
                extent of employing acts of harassment, intimidation and threats. She eventually filed the
                aforementioned administrative case against him in a letter-complaint dated July 24, 1995.<br><br>The
                said complaint sought the dismissal of private respondent for violation of Section 19, Republic Act No.
                6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989) and Section 36 of Presidential Decree No. 807 (Civil Service Decree), with
                an ancillary prayer for his preventive suspension. For purposes of this case, the charges referred to
                may be subsumed under the category of oppression, misconduct, and disgraceful or immoral
                conduct.<br><br>On January 31, 1996, Graft Investigator Eduardo R. Benitez issued a resolution finding
                private respondents guilty of grave misconduct and ordering his dismissal from the service with
                forfeiture of all benefits under the law. His resolution bore the approval of Director Napoleon Baldrias
                and Assistant Ombudsman Abelardo Aportadera of their office.<br><br>Herein respondent Ombudsman, in an
                Order dated February 26, 1996, approved the aforesaid resolution with modifications, by finding private
                respondent guilty of misconduct and meting out the penalty of suspension without pay for one year. After
                private respondent moved for reconsideration, respondent Ombudsman discovered that the former's new
                counsel had been his "classmate and close associate" hence he inhibited himself. The case was
                transferred to respondent Deputy Ombudsman Jesus F. Guerrero who, in the now challenged Joint Order of
                June 18, 1997, set aside the February 26, 1997 Order of respondent Ombudsman and exonerated private
                respondents from the administrative charges.<br><br>
                <center><b>II</b></center>
                <br>In the present appeal, petitioner argues that Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 (Ombudsman Act of
                1989)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> pertinently provides that -<br>
                <blockquote>In all administrative diciplinary cases, orders, directives or decisions of the Office of
                    the Ombudsman may be appealed to the Supreme Court by filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> within
                    ten (10) days from receipt of the written notice of the order, directive or decision or denial of
                    the motion for reconsideration <u>in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.</u> (Emphasis
                    supplied)
                </blockquote>
                However, she points out that under Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07 (Rules of
                Procedure of the office of the Ombudsman),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> when a
                respondent is absolved of the charges in an administrative proceeding decision of the ombudsman is final
                and unappealable. She accordingly submits that the office of the ombudsman has no authority under the
                law to restrict, in the manner provided in its aforesaid Rules, the right of appeal allowed by Republic
                Act No. 6770, nor to limit the power of review of this Court. Because of the aforecited provision in
                those Rules of Procedure, she claims that she found it "necessary to take an alternative recourse under
                Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, because of the doubt it creates on the availability of appeals under Rule
                45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Respondents filed their respective comments and rejoined that the
                Office of the Ombudsman is empowered by the Constitution and the law to promulgate its own rules of
                procedure. Section 13(8), Article XI of the 1987 Constitution provides, among others, that the Office of
                the Ombudsman can "(p)romulgate its rules of procedure and exercise such other powers or perform such
                functions or duties as may be provided by law."<br><br>Republic Act No. 6770 duly implements the
                Constitutional mandate with these relevant provisions:<br>
                <blockquote>Sec. 14. <i>Restrictions.</i> - x x x No court shall hear any appeal or application for
                    remedy against the decision or findings of the Ombudsman except the Supreme Court on pure question

                    <br>Sec. 18. <i>Rules of Procedure.</i> - (1) The Office of the Ombudsman shall promulgate its own

                    <br>Sec. 27. <i>Effectivity and Finality of Decisions.</i> - All provisionary orders at the Office
                    of the Ombudsman are immediately effective and executory.<br><br>A motion for reconsideration of any
                    order, directive or decision of the Office of the Ombudsman must be filed within five (5) days after
                    receipt of written notice shall be entertained only on any of the following grounds:<br><br>
                    <center>x x x</center>
                    <br>Findings of fact by the Office of the Ombudsman when supported by substantial evidence are
                    conclusive. Any order, directive or decision imposing the penalty of public censure or reprimand,
                    suspension of not more than one month salary shall be final and unappealable.<br><br>In all
                    administrative disciplinary cases, orders, directives or decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman
                    may be appealed to the Supreme Court by filing a petition for certiorari within ten (10) days from
                    receipt of the written notice of the order, directive or decision or denial of the motion for
                    reconsideration in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The above rules may be
                    amended or modified by the Office of the Ombudsman as the interest of justice may require.
                </blockquote>
                Respondents consequently contend that, on the foregoing constitutional and statutory authority,
                petitioner cannot assail the validity of the rules of procedure formulated by the Office of the
                Ombudsman governing the conduct of proceeding before it, including those with respect to the availabity
                or non-avalability of appeal in administrative cases. Such as Section 7, Rule III of Administrative
                Order No.07.<br><br>Respondents also question the propriety of petitioner's proposition that, although
                she definitely prefaced her petition by categorizing the same as "an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45
                of the Rules of Court," she makes the aforequoted ambivalent statement which in effect asks that, should
                the remedy under Rule 45 be unavailable, her petition be treated in the alternative as an original
                action for certiorari under Rule 65. The parties thereafter engage in a discussion of the differences
                between a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 and a special civil action of certiorari under
                Rule 65.<br><br>Ultimately, they also attempt to review and rationalize the decision of this Court
                applying Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Section 7, Rule III of
                Administrative Order No. 07. As correctly pointed out by public respondents, <i>Ocampo IV vs. Ombudsman,
                    et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and <i>Young vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et
                    al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> were original actions for certiorari under Rule
                65. <i>Yabut vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was
                commenced by a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. Then came <i>Cruz, Jr. vs. People, et
                    al.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Olivas vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et
                    al.,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Olivarez vs. Sandiganbayan, et
                    al.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and <i>Jao, et al. vs. Vasquez,</i><sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which were for <i>certiorari,</i> prohibition and/or
                mandamus under Rule 65. <i>Alba vs. Nitorreda, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
                was initiated by a pleading unlikely denominated as an "Appeal/Petition for Certiorari and/or
                Prohibition," with a prayer for ancillary remedies, and ultimately followed by <i>Constantino vs. Hon.
                    Ombudsman Aniano Desierto, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which was a
                special civil action for certiorari.<br><br>Considering, however the view that this Court now takes of
                the case at bar and the issues therein which will shortly be explained, it refrains from preemptively
                resolving the controverted points raised by the parties on the nature and propriety of application of
                the writ of certiorari when used as a mode of appeal or as the basis of a special original action, and
                whether or not they may be resorted to concurrently or alternatively, obvious though the answers thereto
                appear to be. Besides, some seemingly <i>obiter</i> statements in <i>Yabuts</i> and <i>Alba</i> could
                bear reexamination and clarification. Hence, we will merely observe and lay down the rule at this
                juncture that Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 is involved only whenever an appeal by certiorari
                under Rule 45 is taken from a decision in an administrative diciplinary action. It cannot be taken into
                account where an original action for certiorari under Rule 65 is resorted to as a remedy for judicial
                review, such as from an incident in a criminal action.<br><br>
                <center><b>III</b></center>
                <br>After respondents' separate comments had been filed, the Court was intrigued by the fact, which does
                appear to have been seriously considered before, that the administrative liability of a public official
                could fall under the jurisdiction of both the Civil Service Commission and the Office of the Ombudsman.
                Thus, the offenses imputed to herein private respondent were based on both Section 19 of Republic Act.
                No. 6770 and Section 36 of Presidential Decree No. 807. Yet, pursuant to the amendment of section 9,
                Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 by Republic Act No. 7902, all adjudications by Civil Service Commission in
                administrative disciplinary cases were made appealable to the Court of Appeals effective March 18, 1995,
                while those of the Office of the Ombudsman are appealable to this Court.<br><br>It could thus be
                possible that in the same administrative case involving two respondents, the proceedings against one
                could eventually have been elevated to the Court of Appeals, while the other may have found its way to
                the Ombudsman from which it is sought to be brought to this Court. Yet systematic and efficient case
                management would dictate the consolidation of those cases in the Court of Appeals, both for expediency
                and to avoid possible conflicting decisions.<br><br>Then there is the consideration that Section 30,
                Article VI of the 1987 Constitution provides that "(n)o law shall be passed increasing the appellate
                indiction of the Supreme Court as provided in this Constitution without its advice and consent," and
                that Republic Act No. 6770, with its challenged Section 27, took effect on November 17, 1989, obviously
                in spite of that constitutional grounds must be raised by a party to the case, neither of whom did so in
                this case, but that is not an inflexible rule, as we shall explain.<br><br>Since the constitution is
                intended fort the observance of the judiciary and other departments of the government and the judges are
                sworn to support its provisions, the courts are not at liberty to overlook or disregard its commands or
                countenance evasions thereof. When it is clear that a statute trangresses the authority vested in a
                legislative body, it is the duty of the courts to declare that the constitution, and not the statute,

                certain exceptions. It does not preclude a court from inquiring into its own jurisdiction or compel it
                to enter a judgement that it lacks jurisdiction to enter. If a statute on which a court's jurisdiction
                in a proceeding depends is unconstitutional, the court has no jurisdiction in the proceeding, and since
                it may determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, it necessarily follows that it may inquire into the

                foregoing authorities notwithstanding, the Court believed that the parties hereto should be further
                heard on this constitutional question. Correspondingly, the following resolution was issued on May 14,
                1998, the material parts stating as follows:<br>
                <blockquote>The Court observes that the present petition, from the very allegations thereof, is "an
                    appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from the 'Joint Order (Re: Motion for
                    Reconsideration)' issued in OMB-Adm. Case No. 0-95-0411, entitled 'Teresita G. Fabian vs. Engr.
                    Nestor V. Agustin, Asst. Regional Director, Region IV-A, EDSA, Quezon City,' which absolved the
                    latter from the administrative charges for grave misconduct, among other."<br><br>It is further
                    averred therein that the present appeal to this Court is allowed under Section 27 of the Ombudsman
                    Act of 1987 (R.A. No. 6770) and, pursuant thereto, the Office of the Ombudsman issued its Rules of
                    Procedure, Section 7 whereof is assailed by petitioner in this proceeding. It will be recalled that
                    R.A. No. 6770 was enacted on November 17, 1989, with Section 27 thereof pertinently providing that
                    all administrative diciplinary cases, orders, directives or decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman
                    may be appealed to this Court in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The Court
                    notes, however, that neither the petition nor the two comments thereon took into account or
                    discussed the validity of the aforestated Section 27 of R.A. No. 8770 in light of the provisions of
                    Section 30, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution that "(n)o law shall be passed increasing the
                    appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided in this Constitution without its advise and
                    consent."<br><br>The Court also invites the attention of the parties to its relevant ruling in First
                    Lepanto Ceramics, Inc. vs. The Court of Appeals , et al. (G.R. No. 110571, October 7, 1994, 237 SCRA
                    519) and the provisions of its former Circular No. 1-95,as now substantially reproduced in Rule 43
                    of the 1997 revision of the Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>In view of the fact that the appellate
                    jurisdiction of the Court is invoked and involved and in this case, and the foregoing legal
                    consideration appear to impugn the constitutionality and validity of the grant of said appellate
                    jurisdiction to it, the Court deems it necessary that the parties be heard thereon and the issue be
                    first resolved before conducting further proceedings in this appellate review.<br><br>ACCORDINGLY,
                    the Court Resolved to require the parties to Submit their position and arguments on the matter
                    subject of this resolution by filing their corresponding pleadings within ten (10) days from notice
                    hereof.

                <br>The records do not show that the Office of the Solicitor General has complied with such requirement,
                hence the Court dispenses with any submission it should have presented. On the other hand, petitioner
                espouses the theory that the provision in Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 which authorizes an appeal
                by certiorari to this Court of the aforementioned adjudications of the Ombudsman is not violative of
                Section 30, Article VI of the Constitution. She claims that what is proscribed is the passage of law
                "increasing" the appellate jurisdiction of this Court "as provided in this Constitution," and such
                appellate jurisdiction includes "all cases in which only an error or question of law is involved." Since
                Section 5(2)(e), Article VIII of the Constitution authorizes this Court to review, revise, reverse,
                modify, or affirm on appeal or certiorari the aforesaid final judgement or orders "as the law or the
                Rules of Court may provide," said Section 27 does not increase this Court may provide," said section 27
                does not increase this Court's appellate jurisdiction since, by providing that the mode of appeal shall
                be by petition for certiorari under Rule 45, then what may be raised therein are only questions of law
                of which this Court already has of which this Court already has jurisdiction.<br><br>We are not
                impressed by this discourse. It overlooks the fact that by jurisprudential developments over the years,
                this Court has allowed appeals by certiorari under Rule 45 in a substantial number of cases and
                instances even if questions of fact are directly involved and have to be resolved by the appellate
                court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Also, the very provision cited by petitioner
                specifies that the appellate jurisdiction of this Court contemplated therein is to be exercised over
                "final judgements and orders of <i>lower courts,</i>" that is, the courts composing the integrated
                judicial system. It does not include the quasi-judicial bodies or agencies, hence whenever the
                legislature intends that the decisions or resolutions of the quasi-judicial agency shall be reviewable
                by the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, a specific provision to that effect is included in the law
                creating that quasi-judicial agency and, for that matter, any special statutory court. No such provision
                on appellate procedure is required for the regular courts of the integrated judicial system because they
                are what are referred to and already provided for in Section 5, Article VIII of the
                Constitution.<br><br>Apropos to the foregoing, and as correctly observed by private respondent, the
                revised Rules of Civil Procedure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> preclude appeals from
                quasi-judicial agencies to the Supreme Court via a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. In
                the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Section 1 Rule 45, on "Appeal by Certiorari to the Supreme Court,"
                explicitly states:<br>
                <blockquote>SECTION 1 . <i>Filing of petition with Supreme Court.</i> - A person desiring to appeal by
                    certiorari from a judgement or final order or Resolution of the <i>Court of Appeals, the
                        Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other court whenever authorized by law,</i> may file
                    with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari. The petition shall raise only
                    question of law which must be distinctly set forth. (Italics ours).
                </blockquote>
                This differs from the former Rule 45 of the 1964 Rules of Court which made mention only of the Court of
                Appeals, and had to be adopted in statutes creating and providing for appeals from certain
                administrative or quasi-judicial agencies, whenever the purpose was to restrict the scope of the appeal
                to questions of law. That intended limitation on appellate review, as we have just discussed, was not
                fully subserved by recourse to the former Rule 45 but, then, at that time there was no uniform rule on
                appeals from quasi-judicial agencies.<br><br>Under the present Rule 45, appeals may be brought through a
                petition for review on certiorari but only from judgments and final orders of the <i>courts</i>
                enumerated in Section 1 thereof. Appeals from judgments and final orders of <i>quasi-judicial
                    agencies</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> are now required to be brought to the
                Court of Appeals on a verified petition for review, under the requirements and conditions in Rule 43
                which was precisely formulated and adopted to provide for a uniform rule of appellate procedure for
                quasi-judicial agencies .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>It is suggested, however,
                that the provisions of Rule 43 should apply only to "ordinary" quasi-judicial agencies, but not to the
                Office of the Ombudsman which is a "high constitutional body." We see no reason for this distinction
                for, if hierarchical rank should be a criterion, that proposition thereby disregards the fact that Rule
                43 even includes the Office of the President and the Civil Service Commission, although the latter is
                even an independent constitutional commission, unlike the Office of the Ombudsman which is a
                constitutionally-mandated but statutorily created body.<br><br>Regarding the misgiving that the review
                of the decision of the Office of the Ombudsman by the Court of Appeals would cover questions of law, of
                fact or of both, we do not perceive that as an objectionable feature. After all, factual controversies
                are usually involved in administrative disciplinary actions, just like those coming from the Civil
                Service, Commission, and the Court of Appeals as a trier of fact is better prepared than this Court to
                resolve the same. On the other hand, we cannot have this situation covered by Rule 45 since it now
                applies only to appeals from the regular courts. Neither can we place it under Rule 65 since the review
                therein is limited to jurisdictional questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup><br><br>The
                submission that because this Court has taken cognizance of cases involving Section 27 of Republic Act
                No. 6770, that fact may be viewed as "acquiescence" or "acceptance" by it of the appellate jurisdiction
                contemplated in said Section 27, is unfortunately too tenuous. The jurisdiction of a court is not of
                acquiescence as a matter of fact but an issue of conferment as a matter of law. Besides, we have already
                discussed the cases referred to, including the inaccuracies of some statements therein, and we have
                pointed out the instances when Rule 45 is involved, hence covered by Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770
                now under discussion, and when that provision would not apply if it is a judicial review under Rule
                65.<br><br>Private respondent invokes the rule that courts generally avoid having to decide a
                constitutional question, especially when the case can be decided on other grounds. As a general
                proposition that is correct. Here, however, there is an actual case susceptible of judicial
                determination. Also, the constitutional question, at the instance of this Court, was raised by the
                proper parties, although there was even no need for that because the Court can rule on the matter <i>sua
                    sponte</i> when its appellate jurisdiction is involved. The constitutional question was timely
                raised, although it could even be raised any time likewise by reason of the jurisdictional issue
                confronting the Court. Finally, the resolution of the constitutional issue here is obviously necessary
                for the resolution of the present case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>It is,
                however, suggested that this case could also be decided on other grounds, short of passing upon; the
                constitutional question. We appreciate the ratiocination of private respondent but regret that we must
                reject the same. That private respondent could be absolved of the charge because the decision
                exonerating him is final and unappealable assumes that Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No.
                07 is valid, but that is precisely one of the issues here. The prevailing rule that the Court should not
                interfere with the discretion of the Ombudsman in prosecuting or dismissing a complaint is not
                applicable in this administrative case, as earlier explained. That two decisions rendered by this Court
                supposedly imply the validity of the aforementioned Section 7 of Rule III is precisely under review here
                because of some statements therein somewhat at odds with settled rules and the decisions of this Court
                on the same issues, hence to invoke the same would be to beg the question.<br><br>
                <center><b>V</b></center>
                <br>Taking all the foregoing circumstances in their true legal roles and effects, therefore, Section 27
                of Republic Act No. 6770 cannot validly authorize an <i>appeal</i> to this Court from decisions of the
                Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases. It consequently violates the proscription
                in Section 30, Article VI of the Constitution against a law which increases the <i>Appellate</i>
                jurisdiction of this Court. No countervailing argument has been cogently presented to justify such
                disregard of the constitutional prohibition which, as correctly explained in <i>First Leparto Ceramics,
                    Inc. vs. The Court of Appeals, el al.</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> was
                intended to give this Court a measure of control over cases placed under its appellate Jurisdiction.
                Otherwise, the indiscriminate enactment of legislation enlarging its appellate jurisdiction would
                unnecessarily burden the Court <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>We perforce have to
                likewise reject the supposed inconsistency of the ruling in <i>First Lepanto Ceramics</i> and some
                statements in <i>Yabut</i> and <i>Alba,</i> not only because of the difference in the factual settings,
                but also because those isolated cryptic statements in <i>Yabut</i> and <i>Alba</i> should best be
                clarified in the adjudication on the merits of this case. By way of anticipation, that will have to be
                undertaken by the proper court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>Furthermore in addition to our
                preceding discussion on whether Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 expanded the jurisdiction of this
                Court without its advice and consent, private respondent's position paper correctly yields the
                legislative background of Republic Act No. 6770. On September 26, 1989, the Conference Committee Report
                on S.B. No. 453 and H.B. No. 13646, setting forth the new version of what would later be Republic Act
                No. 6770, was approved on second reading by the House of Representatives.<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Senate was informed of the approval of the final
                version of the Act on October 2, 1989 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and the same was
                thereafter enacted into law by President Aquino on November 17, 1989.<br><br>Submitted with said
                position paper is an excerpt showing that the Senate, in the deliberations on the procedure for appeal
                from the Office of the Ombudsman to this Court, was aware of the provisions of Section 30, Article III
                of the Constitution. It also reveals that Senator Edgardo Angara, as a co-author and the principal
                sponsor of S.B. No. 543 admitted that the said provision will expand this Court's jurisdiction, and that
                the Committee on Justice and Human Rights had not consulted this Court on the matter, thus:<br><br>
                <center><b>INTERPELLATION OF SENATOR SHAHANI</b></center>
                <br>
                <center><b>x x x</b></center>
                <br>Thereafter, with reference to Section 22(4) which provides that the decisions of the Office of the
                Ombudsman may be appealed to the Supreme Court, in reply to Senator Shahani's query whether the Supreme
                Court would agree to such provision in the light of Section 30, Article VI of the Constitution which
                requires its advice and concurrence in laws increasing its appellate jurisdiction, Senator Angara
                informed that the Committee has not yet consulted the Supreme Court regarding the matter. He agreed that
                the provision will expand the Supreme Court's jurisdiction by allowing appeals through petitions for
                review, adding that they should be appeals on <i>certiorari.</i><sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <br><br>There is no showing that even up to its
                enactment, Republic Act No. 6770 was ever referred to this Court for its advice and consent .<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>
                <center><b>VI</b></center>
                <br>As a consequence of our ratiocination that Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 should be struck down
                as unconstitutional, and in line with the regulatory philosophy adopted in appeals from quasi-judicial
                agencies in the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, appeals from decisions of the Office of the
                Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the Court of Appeals under the
                provisions of Rule 43.<br><br>There is an intimation in the pleadings, however, that said Section 27
                refers to appellate jurisdiction which, being substantive in nature, cannot be disregarded by this Court
                under its rule-making power, especially if it results in a diminution, increase or modification of
                substantive rights. Obviously, however, where the law is procedural in essence and purpose, the
                foregoing consideration would not pose a proscriptive issue against the exercise of the rule-making
                power of this Court. This brings to fore the question of whether Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 is
                substantive or procedural.<br><br>It will be noted that no definitive line can be drawn between those
                rules or statutes which are procedural, hence within the scope of this Court's rule-making power, and
                those which are substantive. In fact, a particular rule may be procedural in one context and substantive
                in another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It is admitted that what is procedural and
                what is substantive is frequently a question of great difficulty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
                It is not, however, an insurmountable problem if a rational and pragmatic approach is taken within the
                context of our own procedural and jurisdictional system.<br><br>In determining whether a rule prescribed
                by the Supreme Court, for the practice and procedure of the lower courts, abridges, enlarges, or
                modifies any substantive right, the test is whether the rule really regulates procedure, that is, the
                <i>judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law</i> and for justly
                administering remedy and redress for a disregard or infraction of them.<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> If the rule takes away a vested right, it is not
                procedural. If the rule creates a right such as the right to appeal, it may be classified as a
                substantive matter; but <i>if it operates as a means o implementing an existing right then the rule
                    deals merely with procedure.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the
                situation under consideration, a transfer by the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its rule-making
                power, of pending cases involving a review of decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative
                disciplinary actions to the Court of Appeals which shall now be vested with exclusive appellate
                jurisdiction thereover, relates to procedure only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This is
                so because it is not the right to appeal of an aggrieved party which is affected by the law. That <i>right</i>
                has been preserved. Only the <i>procedure</i> by which the appeal is to be made or decided has been
                changed. The rationale for this is that litigant has a vested right in a particular remedy, which may be
                changed by substitution without impairing vested rights, hence he can have none in rules of procedure
                which relate to the remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, it cannot
                be said that transfer of appellate jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals in this case is an act of
                creating a new right of appeal because such power of the Supreme Court to transfer appeals to
                subordinate appellate courts is purely a procedural and not a substantive power. Neither can we consider
                such transfer as impairing a vested right because the parties have still a remedy and still a competent
                tribunal to administer that remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Thus, it has
                been generally held that rules or statutes involving a transfer of cases from one court to another, are
                procedural and remedial merely and that, as such, they are applicable to actions pending at the time the
                statute went into effect<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or, in the case at bar, when its
                invalidity was declared. Accordingly, even from the standpoint of jurisdiction <i>ex hypothesi</i> the
                validity of the transfer of appeals in said cases to the Court of Appeals can be sustained.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b>
