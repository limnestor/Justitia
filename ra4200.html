                1. It shall be unlawful for any person, not being authorized by all the parties to any private
                communication or spoken word, to tap any wire or cable, or by using any other device or arrangement, to
                secretly overhear, intercept, or record such communication or spoken word by using a device commonly
                known as a dictaphone or dictagraph or detectaphone or walkie-talkie or taperecorder, or however
                otherwise described:<br><br>It shall also be unlawful for any person, be he a participant or not in the
                act or acts penalized in the next preceding sentence, to knowingly possess any tape record, wire record,
                disc record, or any other such record, or copies thereof, of any communication or spoken word secured
                either before or after the effective date of this Act in the manner prohibited by this law; or to replay
                the same for any other person or persons; or to communicate the contents thereof, either verbally or in
                writing, or to furnish transcriptions thereof, whether complete or partial, to any other person: <span
                        style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> That the use of such record or any copies thereof
                as evidence in any civil, criminal investigation or trial of offenses mentioned in section 3 hereof,
                shall not be covered by this prohibition.<br><br>SEC. 2. Any person who wilfully or knowingly does or
                who shall aid, permit, or cause to be done any of the acts declared to be unlawful in the preceding
                section or who violates the provisions of the following section or of any order issued thereunder, or
                aids, permits, or causes such violation shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment for
                not less than six months or more than six years and with the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute
                disqualification from public office if the offender be a public official at the time of the commission
                of the offense, and, if the offender is an alien he shall be subject to deportation proceedings.<br><br>SEC.
                3. Nothing contained in this Act, however, shall render it unlawful or punishable for any peace officer,
                who is authorized by a written order of the Court, to execute any of the acts declared to be unlawful in
                the two preceding sections in cases involving the crimes of treason, espionage, provoking war and
                disloyalty in case of war, piracy, mutiny in the high seas, rebellion, conspiracy and proposal to commit
                rebellion, inciting to rebellion, sedition, conspiracy to commit sedition, inciting to sedition,

                espionage and other offenses against national security: <span
                        style="font-style: italic;">Provided, </span>That such written order shall only be issued or
                granted upon written application and the examination under oath or affirmation of the applicant and the
                witnesses he may produce and a showing: (1) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that any of the
                crimes enumerated hereinabove has been committed or is being committed or is about to be committed:
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however, </span>That in cases involving the offenses of
                rebellion, conspiracy and proposal to commit rebellion, inciting to rebellion, sedition, conspiracy to
                commit sedition, and inciting to sedition, such authority shall be granted only upon prior proof that a
                rebellion or acts of sedition, as the case may be, have actually been or are being committed; (2) that
                there are reasonable grounds to believe that evidence will be obtained essential to the conviction of
                any person for, or to the solution of, or to the prevention of, any of such crimes; and (3) that there
                are no other means readily available for obtaining such evidence.<br><br>The order granted or issued
                shall specify: (1) the identity of the person or persons whose communications, conversations,
                discussions, or spoken words are to be overheard, intercepted, or recorded and in the case of

                location; (2) the identity of the peace officer authorized to overhear, intercept, or record the
                communications, conversations, discussions, or spoken words; (3) the offense or offenses committed or
                sought to be prevented; and (4) the period of the authorization. The authorization shall be effective
                for the period specified in the order which shall not exceed sixty (60) days from the date of issuance
                of the order, unless extended or renewed by the court upon being satisfied that such extension or
                renewal is in the public interest.<br><br>All recordings made under court authorization shall, within
                forty-eight hours after the expiration of the period fixed in the order, be deposited with the court in
                a sealed envelope or sealed package, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the peace officer
                granted such authority stating the number of recordings made, the dates and times covered by each
                recording, the number of tapes, discs, or records included in the deposit, and certifying that no
                duplicates or copies of the whole or any part thereof have been made, or if made, that all such
                duplicates or copies are included in the envelope or package deposited with the court. The envelope or
                package so deposited shall not be opened, or the recordings replayed, or used in evidence, or their
                contents revealed, except upon order of the court, which shall not be granted except upon motion, with
                due notice and opportunity to be heard to the person or persons whose conversation or communications
                have been recorded.<br><br>The court referred to in this section shall be understood to mean the Court
                of First Instance within whose territorial jurisdiction the acts for which authority is applied for are
                to be executed.<br><br>SEC. 4. Any communication or spoken word, or the existence, contents, substance,
                purport, effect, or meaning of the same or any part thereof, or any information therein contained
                obtained or secured by any person in violation of the preceding sections of this Act shall not be
                admissible in evidence in any judicial, quasi-judicial, legislative or administrative hearing or
                investigation.<br><br>SEC. 5. All laws inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed
                or accordingly amended.<br><br>SEC. 6. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.<br><br>Approved,
                June 19, 1965.<br></div>
