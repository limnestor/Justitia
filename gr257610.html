He further claimed to be a registered voter, above 25 years old, able to read and write, and has been a member in good standing of the Philippine Bar with 15 years of legal practice and experience. Prior to his nomination, Albano ran for city councilor for the City of Taguig during the 2019 elections and lost.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thereafter, he continued to serve TGP as the Chief Political Affairs Officer and its Chief of Staff.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In the 2022 elections, Albano's loss in the previous 2019 elections rendered him ineligible to participate therein as the second nominee of TGP, pursuant to the restrictions imposed by Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941 and, consequently, by Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717.<br><br>As a parallel development, Catalina G. Leonen-Pizarro (<i>Pizarro</i>) is the current president and the first nominee in the 2022 elections of the Arts Business and Science Professionals (<i>ABS</i>), a sectoral party she founded in 2007. Previously, she served as the representative of ABS in the House of Representatives (<i>House</i>) for three consecutive terms, from 2007 to 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> After completing her term, she ran for mayor in the Municipality of Sudipen, La Union in the 2016 and 2019 elections, but failed in her bid both times.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Despite her selection as first nominee for the 2022 elections, Pizarro's bid was also hampered by the promulgation of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717 and the media pronouncement of the COMELEC, preventing defeated candidates in the 2019 elections from eyeing a political comeback through the party-list system in the House of Representatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Seeking recourse with this Court, Pizarro and Albano separately filed Petitions for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition, docketed as UDK No. 17230 and G.R. No. 257610, respectively, to declare Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941 and Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717 unconstitutional.<br><br>For context, the challenged provision under R.A. No. 7941 prevents a candidate for any elective office or a person who has lost in the immediately preceding elections from being included in the list of nominees for party-list representatives. Section 8 reads as follows:<br><blockquote>SECTION 8. <i>Nomination of Party-List Representatives</i>. &#8211; Each registered party, organization or coalition shall submit to the COMELEC not later than forty-five (45) days before the election a list of names, not less than five (5) from which party-list representatives shall be chosen in case it obtains the required number of votes.<br><br>A person may be nominated in one (1) list only. Only persons who have given their consent in writing may be named in the list. The list shall not include any candidate for any elective office or a person who has lost his bid for elective office in the immediately preceding election. No change of names or alteration of the order of nominees shall be allowed after the same shall have been submitted to the COMELEC except in cases where the nominee dies, or withdraws in writing his nomination, becomes incapacitated in which case the name of the substitute nominee shall be placed last in the list. Incumbent sectoral representatives in the House of Representatives who are nominated in the party-list system shall not be considered resigned.</blockquote>Section 8 was eventually adopted in the also challenged Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717, which provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. <i>Contents and Form of the Certificate of Nomination</i>. &#8211; The Certificate of Nomination of a PP, sectoral party, organization or Coalition shall contain the following:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Name of the PP, sectoral party, organization or Coalition;<br><br></li><li>Name of the Chairperson/President/Secretary-General of the nominating PP, sectoral party, organization or Coalition;<br><br></li><li>Name and Address of all the nominees;<br><br></li><li>A certification that the nominees have all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications provided by law and that they are not candidates for any elective office or have lost in their bid for an elective office in the May 13, 2019 National and Local Elections;<br><br></li><li>A documentary stamp in the amount of Thirty Pesos (Php30.00);<br><br></li><li>The signature and attestation under oath, either by the Chairperson, President, Secretary-General or any other duly authorized officer of the nominating PP, sectoral party, organization or coalition. x x x<br><br><center>x x x x</center></li></ol></blockquote>SECTION 10. <i>Nomination of Party-List Representatives</i>. &#8211; A person may be nominated in one (1) list only. Only persons who have given their consent in writing may be named in the list. The list shall not include any candidate for any elective office or a person who has lost his bid for an elective office in the May 13, 2019 National and Local Elections. No change of names or alterations of the order of nominees shall be allowed after the same shall have been submitted to the Commission except in cases where the nominee dies, becomes incapacitated, or there is valid withdrawal and substitution of nominees as provided in the succeeding sections, in which case, the name of the substitute nominee shall be placed last in the list.</blockquote>Considering the identity of facts and issues, the instant petitions were consolidated <i>via</i> a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated August 23, 2022.<br><br><center><b><i>Issues</i></b></center><br>The pivotal issues raised in the consolidated petitions are:<br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>Whether Congress may prescribe additional qualifications other than what is provided in Section 6, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution; and<br><br><center>II.</center><br>Whether Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941 and Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717 are unconstitutional for violating the equal protection clause of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><center><b>This Court's Ruling<br><br></b></center>The petitions are partly meritorious.<br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><em>Congress is empowered to determine, by law, who shall be elected through the party&shy;-list system and, therefore, determine the qualifications of the party-list representatives elected under this system.</em></div></td><td width="70%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>In essence, petitioners insist that Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941 and Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717 illegally imposes an additional qualification on party-list aspirants. They maintain that a candidate for a member of the House of Representatives needs only to meet the qualifications set forth in Section 6,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Article VI of the 1987 Constitution. Beyond such qualifications, candidates need not possess any other qualification to be voted upon and elected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Consequently, the act of Congress in adding another requirement by law effectively amends the 1987 Constitution, which Congress has no power to do, following the ruling in <i>Social Justice Society</i> (<i>SJS</i>) <i>v. Dangerous Drugs Board, et al.</i> (<i>Social Justice Society</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in G.R. No. 257610, the Office of the Solicitor General (<i>OSG</i>) asserts that Congress merely acted in compliance with and by authority of the express wording of Section 5(1) of the 1987 Constitution in imposing such additional qualifications under R.A. No. 7941.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Effectually, there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the respondent in the issuance of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717, having acted upon a valid statutory provision, pursuant to its constitutional mandate to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The OSG adds in its Comment in UDK No. 17230<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that the inclusion of additional requirements for party-list representatives was a valid exercise of the plenary power of Congress, which includes the authority to prescribe qualifications for public office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><i>This Court agrees with the respondent.</i><br><br>To begin with, the party-list system was innovated to serve as a tool for the attainment of social justice. The deliberations of the members of the Constitutional Commission reflect that the purpose of the party-list system was to give "genuine power to our people" and that the inclusion of such a mechanism in the Constitution symbolizes a "new chapter to our national history."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As elaborated in <i>Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. Commission on Elections</i> (<i>Bagong Bayani</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the party-list system, in its noblest sense, "intends to make the marginalized and the underrepresented not merely passive recipients of the State's benevolence, but active participants in the mainstream of representative democracy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The party-list system finds its mooring in the 1987 Constitution. Party-list organizations that gamer a sufficient number of votes shall form part of the House through their chosen nominees. Section 5(1), Article VI reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. (1) The House of Representatives shall be composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members, unless otherwise fixed by law, who shall be elected from legislative districts apportioned among the provinces, cities, and the Metropolitan Manila area in accordance with the number of their respective inhabitants, and on the basis of a uniform and progressive ratio, and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations.</blockquote>Aside from distinctly defining the composition of the House, the last phrase of the provision simultaneously empowers the legislature to formulate the allocation of party-list seats for winning party-list organizations. This was the Court's interpretation in <i>Barangay Association for National Advancement and Transparency</i> (<i>BANAT</i>) <i>v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>The allocation of seats under the party-list system is governed by the last phrase of Section 5(1), which states that the party-list representatives shall be "those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system," giving the Legislature wide discretion in formulating the allocation of party-list seats.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>In <i>Abayon v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court clarified that while it is the party-list organization that is being voted upon by the electorate, it is not the organization, but the individual who eventually sits as and becomes a member of the House:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><blockquote>Clearly, the members of the House of Representatives are of two kinds: "members x x x who shall be elected from legislative districts" and "those who x x x shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations." This means that, from the Constitution's point of view, it is the party-list representatives who are "elected" into office, not their parties or organizations. These representatives are elected, however, through that peculiar party-list system that the Constitution authorized and that Congress by law established where the voters cast their votes for the organizations or parties to which such party-list representatives belong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>Guided by the foregoing, Section 5(1), Article VI of the Constitution is more appropriately understood to mean that the allocation of party-list seats pertains to party-list representatives, who act for and on behalf of their respective organizations. Elsewise stated, the allocation of party-list seats to party-list representatives, specifically as to "who shall be elected" through a party-list system, pertains not only to the party-list organization but also to the party-list representative, who shall eventually sit as a member of the House.<br><br>Ultimately then, the issue as to "who shall be elected" as provided in the last phrase of Section 5(1), Article VI has been delegated to Congress&#8212;for in order to answer the question as to "who shall be elected," it is not only the number of party-list representatives who would occupy the house that must be considered; the qualifications of those who seek such positions are also embraced therein.<br><br>A review of the deliberations of Section 5(1), Article VI of the Constitutional Commission would reveal the clear intent of the framers to delegate to Congress, who is in the best position to draft, study, and enact all the details regarding the implementation of the party-list system, the determination of the qualifications of nominees of the party-list system, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>MR. RODRIGO. x x x In the light of the phrase "AS PROVIDED BY LAW," do I take it that this party list system and the sectoral representation provision will not take effect until an enabling act or an implementing legislation shall have been enacted by Congress?<br><br>MR. MONSOD. Madam President, the first Assembly will be in March or April. But <b>when we say, "AS PROVIDED BY LAW," it could really mean that it may be by ordinance appended to this [C]onstitution or an executive order by the incumbent President or, as the Gentlemen has said, by law provided by the incoming Congress</b>. So, it could be any of these ways.<br><br>MR. RODRIGO. Madam President, we are all witnesses to the difficulty in arriving at a consensus of these very novel ideas on the disputes that we have had. And up to now, there is no real consensus yet. Does the Commissioner believe that we should really try to go into the details by enacting an ordinance to the Constitution? x x x<br><br>MR. MONSOD. We just want to establish the principle of the party list system with sectoral representation in the present Constitution. x x x<br><br>MR. RODRIGO. Considering our time constraint and the many other provisions that we have not yet discussed, <b>does the Commissioner believe that we are in a position to draft, study, and enact a virtual piece of legislation, with all details, regarding the implementation of this party-&shy;list system and sectoral representation, so that it will be finished in time for the approval of this Constitution? Should we not abandon that idea and leave this matter to the legislature?</b><br><br>MR. MONSOD. I believe that it is really not a very complicated system, and it is possible. But I will yield to the time problem, if there is really a time problem. Certainly, I do not think that this Commission would want to put an ordinance that is half-baked.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>As aptly observed by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa:<br><blockquote>x x x [T]he framers' penultimate goal is to have a system of party-list system. With respect, however, to the details as of its implementation, the same was envisioned to be appended to the Constitution or, <i>in the alternative</i>, to be enacted by the President or the legislature. This evinces the intent of the framers to delegate the broad power of formulating rules operationalizing the party-list system, in the event that the same could not be made part of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>In obeisance to Section 5(1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, particularly the phrase "as provided by law," Congress enacted R.A. No. 7941. This Court, in <i>Bagong Bayani</i>, explained that such phrase, in relation to the party-list system, is categorical in its terms: "the mechanics of the [party-list] system shall be provided by law. Pursuant thereto, Congress enacted [R.A.] No. 7941. In understanding and implementing party-list representation, [W]e should[,] therefore[,] look at the law first."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The law has, for its end, the guarantee of a "full, free, and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral, or group interests in the House by enhancing their chances to complete for and win seats in the legislature and shall provide the simplest scheme possible."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Aside from the determination of the mechanics of the party-list system, R.A. No. 7941 streamlined the qualifications of party-list nominees. This was plainly articulated during the law's congressional deliberations, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>What does the Constitution say? The Constitution did not specifically direct that all registered political parties should be allowed to participate in the Party-List system from the outset. What the Constitution provides is, I quote &#8211; "Those who, as provided by law shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations."<br><br>Under the foregoing provision, Congress is given the plenary power to legislate on who shall be qualified to be elected under the party-list system and which national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations are eligible for registration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>In view of these disquisitions, nothing appears to be constitutionally repugnant with R.A. No. 7941, insofar as it embodies the objective of the Constitution to accord Congress <i>imprimatur</i> to sculpt legislation establishing the mechanics of the party-list system, and with it, the qualifications of party&shy;-list representatives and the conduct for their nominations. In line with this and to ensure genuine representation, R.A. No. 7941 even requires, as a qualification for party-list nominees, that [they] be bona fide members of the party or organization which [they] seek to represent for at least 90 days preceding the day of the election.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> To be sure, this Court has since acknowledged R.A. No. 7941 as the "controlling law" in all matters pertaining to the elections of party-list representatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> After all, the opportunity to run for public office is a privilege that may be subject to limitations as imposed by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Finally, the instant case must be distinguished from the ruling and factual circumstances under <i>Social Justice Society</i> which petitioners maintain as squarely applicable.<br><br>In <i>Social Justice Society</i>, then Senator Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr., who was also a candidate for re-election in the May 10, 2004 elections, filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, praying that this Court strike down Section 36(g) of R.A. No. 9165, otherwise known as the <i>Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002</i>, and COMELEC Resolution No. 6486 as unconstitutional for requiring <i>all candidates</i> for public office, both in the national or local government, to undergo a mandatory drug test. Effectively, this created an additional qualification that a candidate must undergo before being allowed to run as a Senator. In granting the petition, this Court ruled that such provisions violate the Constitution by adding a condition <i>sine qua non</i> to the already exclusive requirements enumerated in Article IV thereof. As ruled by this Court:<br><blockquote>Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165, as sought to be implemented by the assailed COMELEC resolution, effectively enlarges the qualification requirements enumerated in the Sec. 3, Art. VI of the Constitution. As couched, said Sec. 36(g) unmistakably requires a candidate for senator to be certified illegal&shy;-drug clean, obviously as a pre-condition to the validity of a certificate of candidacy for senator or, with like effect, a condition <i>sine qua non</i> to be voted upon and, if proper, be proclaimed as senator-elect. The COMELEC resolution completes the chain with the proviso that "[n]o person elected to any public office shall enter upon the duties of his office until he has undergone mandatory drug test." Viewed, therefore, in its proper context, Sec. 36 (g) of RA 9165 and the implementing COMELEC Resolution add another qualification layer to what the 1987 Constitution, at the minimum, requires for membership in the Senate. Whether or not the drug-free bar set up under the challenged provision is to be hurdled before or after election is really of no moment, as getting elected would be of little value if one cannot assume office for non-compliance with the drug-testing requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>The linchpin distinction between this case and <i>Social Justice Society</i> lies in the qualifications of the members of Congress, which are dependent on the classifications of members of the Senate and the House.<br><br>To begin with, senators and senatorial candidates shall mandatorily comply with the qualifications laid down in Section 3, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, which reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. No person shall be a Senator unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, and, on the day of the election, is at least thirty&shy;-five years of age, able to read and write, a registered voter, and a resident of the Philippines for not less than two years immediately preceding the day of the election.</blockquote>It is noteworthy that such provision is silent with regard to any classification insofar as members of the Senate are concerned. Further, unlike Section 5(1) which stipulates the composition of the House, the provision that Congress may, by law, provide for additional qualifications for its members, is conspicuously absent. Accordingly, <i>all</i> members of the Senate and <i>all</i> senatorial candidates must meet <i>all</i> the qualifications set by the 1987 Constitution. To recall the ruling of this Court in <i>Social Justice Society</i>, these qualifications are exclusive, and neither Congress nor the COMELEC, may add to or supplant what the 1987 Constitution had already prescribed.<br><br>On the other hand, the House is classified into two kinds of members in light of Section 5(1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, namely, (1) <i>district</i> representatives, who are elected based on district boundaries and (2) <i>party-list</i> representatives, who are elected on a nationwide basis. In terms of party-list representatives, it has been painstakingly discussed that much room is accorded to Congress in determining <i>who</i> shall be elected as party-list representatives. To repeat, this draws authority from the phrase under Section 5(1): "x x x and those who, as provided by law, shall be elected through a party-list system of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations." Noteworthy is the absence of the phrase with regard to district representatives. Such gap points to the implication that Congress has not been given constitutional consent to add to their qualifications either.<br><br>Guided by the foregoing discussions, it is apparent that <i>Social Justice Society</i> is not on all fours with the instant case.<br><br>Markedly, the core issue in <i>Social Justice Society</i> pertained to the addition of constitutional qualifications, which all senatorial candidates must comply. In contrast, the issue in the instant case revolves around who shall be nominated as <i>party-list representatives</i>, to which Congress may expressly provide for via legislation. Going into the qualifications of nominees, not only did Congress reiterate the eligibility requirements under the constitution, it also provided the specific characteristics attributable to nominees that they must, and must not possess, in line with the objective of the party-list system.<br><br>It again bears emphasis that the phrase "as provided by law" under Section 5(1), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution enables Congress to develop legislation on how party-list representatives are elected. Hence, it would not be an overextension on its part to likewise provide for the selection of party-list nominees as reflected in Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941, and as later adopted and reproduced by the respondent in COMELEC Resolution No. 10717. Given this stark distinction, this Court finds no reason to overturn, much more to disregard and invalidate, the ruling under <i>Social Justice Society</i>.<br><br>In sum, the constitutional prerogative of Congress to enact laws concerning the mechanics of the party-list system, or pertinently in this case, the qualifications of party-list representatives, is settled and should now be laid to rest. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><em>Section 8 of R.A.

As a matter of course, Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941 and Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717 are struck down and hereby declared unconstitutional.<br><br>At the outset, this Court recognizes that regardless of the power of Congress to prescribe the mechanics of the party-list system and to provide for qualifications of party-list representatives by law, it must still yield to the general limitations on legislation and the specific limitations on party-list organizations under the Constitution, particularly the equal protection clause.<br><br>No less than the 1987 Constitution guarantees that no person shall be denied equal protection of the laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In a nutshell, the equal protection clause means that "no person or class of persons shall be deprived of the same protection of laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and in like circumstances."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Famous is the saying of philosopher Aristotle that equality "consists in the same treatment of similar persons."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> On this score, this Court finds apropos the discussion in <i>Victoriano v. Elizalde Rope Workers' Union</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>The guaranty of equal protection of the laws is not a guaranty of equality in the application of the laws upon all citizens of the state. It is not, therefore, a requirement, in order to avoid the constitutional prohibition against inequality, that every man, woman and child should be affected alike by a statute. Equality of operation of statutes does not mean indiscriminate operation on persons merely as such, but on persons according to the circumstances surrounding them. It guarantees equality, not identity of rights. The Constitution does not require that things which are different in fact be treated in law as though they were the same. The equal protection clause does not forbid discrimination as to things that are different. It does not prohibit legislation which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate.<br><br>The equal protection of the laws clause of the Constitution allows classification. Classification in law, as in the other departments of knowledge or practice, is the grouping of things in speculation or practice because they agree with one another in certain particulars. A law is not invalid because of simple inequality. The very idea of classification is that of inequality, so that it goes without saying that the mere fact of inequality in no manner determines the matter of constitutionality. All that is required of a valid classification is that it be reasonable, which means that the classification should be based on substantial distinctions which make for real differences; that it must be germane to the purpose of the law; that it must not be limited to existing conditions only; and that it must apply equally to each member of the class. This Court has held that the standard is satisfied if the classification or distinction is based on a reasonable foundation or rational basis and is not palpably arbitrary.<br><br>In the exercise of its power to make classifications for the purpose of enacting laws over matters within its jurisdiction, the state is recognized as enjoying a wide range of discretion. It is not necessary that the classification be based on scientific or marked differences of things or in their relation. Neither is it necessary that the classification be made with mathematical nicety. Hence legislative classification may in many cases properly rest on narrow distinctions, for the equal protection guaranty does not preclude the legislature from recognizing degrees of evil or harm, and legislation is addressed to evils as they may appear.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>Prescinding therefrom, the clause has never been interpreted as an absolute prohibition on any sort of classification. Better stated, the equal protection clause "does not preclude classification of individuals who may be accorded different treatment under the law, as long as such classification is reasonable and not arbitrary."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Clearly then, the legislature is not proscribed from enacting statutes that would ostensibly create specific classes of persons or objects or affect certain classes of persons or objects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, it stands to reason that a statute that treats one class differently from another does not run counter with the equal protection clause if such classification is valid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The classification, to be reasonable, "(1) must rest on substantial distinctions; (2) must be germane to the purposes of the law; (3) must not be limited to existing conditions only; and (4) must apply equally to all members of the same class."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Over time, jurisprudence developed three tests or levels of scrutiny to determine the propriety of the classification depending on the subject matter involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This Court, in <i>Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan v. Quezon City</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> succinctly laid down the three tests, which are typified by the dual consideration of the interest invoked by the government, along with the means employed to achieve that interest:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x The strict scrutiny test applies when a classification either (<i>i</i>) interferes with the exercise of fundamental rights, including the basic liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, or (<i>ii</i>) burdens suspect classes. The intermediate scrutiny test applies when a classification does not involve suspect classes or fundamental rights, but requires heightened scrutiny, such as in classifications based on gender and legitimacy. Lastly, the rational basis test applies to all other subjects not covered by the first two tests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>In due process and equal protection challenges, this Court accords a deferential attitude to legislative classification and exercises judicial restraint in invalidating a law in light of the broad discretion bestowed to Congress in exercising its legislative power. As reiterated by this Court in <i>La Union Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. Judge Yaranon</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> "as long as there is some basis that can be used by the courts for its decision, the constitutionality of the challenged law will not be touched upon and the case will be decided on other available grounds."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> At any rate, when there is a showing of a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, this Court has usually resorted to the rational basis test.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> However, if the challenge to the statute is premised on the denial of a fundamental right or the perpetuation of prejudice against persons favored by the Constitution with special protection, this Court may more appropriately employ the strict scrutiny test.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Here, this Court finds the use of the rational basis test appropriate. Jurisprudence is clear that there is no fundamental right to run for public office that would invoke the application of the rigorous strict scrutiny test. Neither can an argument be made that the parties involved in this case belong to "quasi-suspect classes" such as gender and legitimacy, to trigger the application of the intermediate scrutiny test.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Foremost is the ruling in <i>Quinto v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> which was overturned in a later resolution, wherein this Court established that "one's interest in seeking office, by itself, is not entitled to constitutional protection."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> In the earlier decision, this Court initially linked the right to run for public office to the fundamental rights of expression and association. However, on reconsideration, the Court recognized that such declaration is devoid of basis and "lies on barren ground."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In overturning the earlier decision, this Court invoked certain decisions of the US Supreme Court, which has persuasive influence in this jurisdiction:<br><blockquote>Accordingly, our assailed Decision's submission that the right to run for public office is "inextricably linked" with two fundamental freedoms &#8212; those of expression and association &#8212; lies on barren ground. American case law has in fact never recognized a fundamental right to express one's political views through candidacy, as to invoke a rigorous standard of review. <i>Bart v. Telford</i> pointedly stated that "[t]he First Amendment does not in terms confer a right to run for public office, and this court has held that it does not do so by implication either." Thus, one's interest in seeking office, by itself, is not entitled to constitutional protection. Moreover, one cannot bring one's action under the rubric of freedom of association, absent any allegation that, by running for an elective position, one is advancing the political ideas of a particular set of voters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>This Court, in <i>Marquez v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> echoed such earlier pronouncement, that "[w]hile Section 26, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that '[t]he State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service,' <i>it is equally undisputed that there is no constitutional right to run for public office. It is, rather, a privilege subject to limitations imposed by law.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Earlier, this Court, in <i>Pamatong v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> espoused the same view by rejecting the postulations of petitioner Pamatong that a constitutional right exists to run for or hold public office. Rather, what is recognized is merely a privilege to run, subject to the limitations imposed by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, given the nonfundamental nature of the right to run or to seek public office, the rational basis test should be applied in analyzing the herein assailed provisions. As expressed by Associate Justice Amy C. Lazaro&shy;-Javier, the use of the rational basis test is apt, as "its premise of invalidating classifications that clearly and unequivocally breach the Constitution is a simple reiteration of the fundamental and straightforward legal doctrine that the Constitution is the supreme law and anything that violates it is void."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Under the rational basis test, the constitutionally assailed law shall be upheld if the legislative classification is shown to rationally further a legitimate state interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> In other words, to survive the rational basis test, all that is required is for there to be a legitimate government interest and a "reasonable connection between it" and the methods used to achieve it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Upon a judicious study of this case, this Court finds that the provisions fail to demonstrate any rational basis to support it. Therefore, it cannot pass constitutional muster.<br><br>There is no quibbling that the assailed provisions serve a legitimate government interest to protect the integrity of the party-list system. Section 2 of R.A. No. 7941 spelled out the policy behind the entire law, which reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. Declaration of Policy. &#8212; The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to the marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature and shall provide the simplest scheme possible.</blockquote>Discernibly, each provision in the law must embody this policy of inclusiveness in attaining its objective of challenging dominant ways in politics by giving an effective platform for all marginalized sectors of society to shape the laws of the land. As emphasized by this Court in <i>Angkla: Ang Partido ng mga Pilipinong Marino, Inc. v. Commission on Elections</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><blockquote>[t]hough enabling sectoral representation, the party-list system is also open to national and regional parties or organizations. It facilitates representation by drawing the focus away from personalities, popularity, and patronage; to programs, principles, and policies. It does not do so by extending extraordinary benefits to select sectors. It challenges voters to see beyond what the dominant electoral system sustains, as well as candidates and political parties to consolidate on considerations other than what may suffice in personality-affirming races won by simple plurality. It allows the forging of organizations and coalitions, and facilitates representation on the basis of ideologies, causes, and ideals that go beyond strict sectoral lines[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></blockquote>Given the legitimate governmental interest that must be upheld, this Court now turns to whether the classification found in the law would rationally further such interest.<br><br>This Court finds that it does not.<br><br>In the instant case, there appears to be two kinds of classifications or distinctions under Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941 and Sections 5(d) and 10 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10717&#8212;<i>first</i>, is the distinction between party-list representatives and district representatives, as the prohibition under the assailed provisions only apply to the former and not the latter; and <i>second</i>, the distinction made within the same class of party-list representatives, or more particularly, those who lost in the "immediately preceding election" <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those who won or did not participate therein.<br><br>This Court has already taken pains in addressing the propriety of the first classification. To recapitulate, Congress is allowed to provide additional qualifications, or in this case, disqualifications, for party-list representatives, having been specifically empowered by Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution. In stark contrast, and in adherence to the ruling in <i>Social Justice Society</i>, Congress cannot add to the qualifications for the positions of senators and district representatives.<br><br><i>Au contraire</i>, the second classification faces a different fate. In actual operation, the classification practically discriminates against candidates who, upon suffering a loss from the previous elections, is barred from attempting to once again express his right to run for an elective office as the law precipitately adjudges him or her as having the intention of taking advantage of the party-list system. Thus, the law haphazardly deprives losing candidates who have a genuine stake in a party-list organization and its causes from representing it as a nominee. Concomitantly, party-lists are effectually disenfranchised by the law for arbitrarily limiting its choices of nominees, regardless of their intention for running.<br><br>On the same plane, such classification also fails to achieve the purpose behind Section 8, which was supposedly included in the law to limit, discourage, and disallow the abuse of the party-list system as a fallback measure for traditional politicians to serve in an elective position. As propounded by Associate Justice Mario V. Lopez during the deliberations of this case, no clear connection appears to exist between the weakness of the candidate in the previous elections and the probability that their participation would frustrate the policy enshrined in R.A. No. 7941. Along the same lines, Justice Caguioa corroborates that "failure in the elections has been attributed to economic disadvantages and lack of strong political bases. It appears that these are precisely the influences that the party-list system seeks to diminish, so that those who are traditionally disadvantaged in politics for being marginalized and underrepresented can have a real chance at becoming a legislator."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Verily, no substantial distinction can be seen to exist between candidates who lost in the immediately preceding election on one hand, and those who won or did not participate therein, on the other. No unique circumstance exists that is attributable to losing candidates in the immediately preceding election which would result in subverting the objective of the party-&shy;list system should they be allowed to participate therein. The classification treating losing candidates in the immediately preceding election differently from other candidates does not find any rational basis.<br><br>Aside from violation of the equal protection clause, the prohibition placed on losing candidates likewise violates the constitutional guaranty of substantive due process.<br><br>As illumined by <i>City of Manila v. Laguio</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> substantive due process asks whether the government has an adequate reason for taking away a person's life, liberty, or property. More importantly, it examines whether there is sufficient justification for governmental action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> As a safeguard against oppressive and arbitrary laws, this Court, using American jurisprudence as a guidepost, instructs that such justification is inextricably linked on the level of scrutiny used. Thus,<br><blockquote>[i]f a law is in an area where only rational basis review is applied, substantive due process is met so long as the law is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. But if it is an area where strict scrutiny is used, such as for protecting fundamental rights, then the government will meet substantive due process only if it can prove that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></blockquote>It bears repeating then that while plenary power is vested in Congress, it may not wield such power arbitrarily. As meticulously explained by this Court, the phrase in the assailed provisions fail to surmount the rational basis. The qualifiers "lost" and "immediately preceding election" do not have any rational basis that would bolster the objective of the party-list law. There is no showing that allowing those who lost as compared to those who won, or even those who did not participate in the immediately preceding election, will have a deleterious effect on the party-list system. Moreover, using as a reference the immediately preceding election, and separating it from the other previous elections does not in any way present a convincing basis that would promote the objective of the party-list system for a genuine representation. It would thus follow that the right to substantive due process was not afforded in the instant case. The prohibition is, in effect, an arbitrary and whimsical intrusion of the right of losing candidates in the immediately preceding elections, by needlessly restraining them from participating in the present elections.<br><br>Further, to sustain the prohibition would be inconsistent with, and instead fail to give life to the policy of R.A. No. 7941 in democratizing political power by developing a "full, free, and open party system to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral, or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Surely, the State cannot require eligibility for public office to be conditioned on the person's ill performance in the previous election. Neither may such performance be used as a rubric to gauge his or her ability to serve.<br><br>As an insight, and in keeping with the spirit and intent behind R.A. No. 7941, more particularly Section 8, this Court finds that the more consistent and sensible prohibition would be to disqualify candidates for an elective position to serve as a party-list representative in the same elections. To restate, the prohibition under Section 8 of R.A. No 7941 reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 8. <i>Nomination of Party-List Representatives</i>. &#8211; x x x<br><br>x x x The list shall not include any candidate for any elective office or a person who has lost his bid for elective office in the immediately preceding election.</blockquote>It must be clarified that the phrase "in the immediately preceding election" pertains to those who lost their bid for elective office and not to any candidate for any elective office. Under the principle of <i>noscitur a sociis</i>, where a particular word or phrase is ambiguous in itself or is equally susceptible of various meanings, its correct construction may be made clear and specific by considering the company of words in which it is found with or with which it is associated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The phrase "immediately preceding election," qualifies the phrase "a person who has lost his bid for elective office" not only because it is the immediate antecedent phrase but also because of the need to make a reference to the particular election year as to when a candidate lost. On the other hand, the phrase "any candidate for any elective office" does not require any reference to a particular election year, as it can easily be understood to refer to the current election year. This means that the prohibition under the first phrase of Section 8 disallows a candidate from simultaneously participating for two electoral positions in the same election: one, as a nominee in a party-list; and another, for a separate elective office.<br><br>This conclusion is undergirded by the deliberations of then Senate Bill No. 1913, which would eventually merge with House Bill No. 3043, to become R.A. No. 7491. During the deliberations, the sponsor, former Senator Arturo Tolentino, was emphatic in placing an embargo to persons who may seek to simultaneously become a candidate for a district representative position and a party-list nominee:<br><blockquote>Senator Tatad. Is there no chance, Mr. President, that a politician who, in fact runs for a congressional seat and at the same time has his name included in the party listing so that even if he loses in the actual combat, if the party gets enough votes as a party under the party-list system, he still gets to sit as a party-list representative?<br><br>Senator Tolentino. That is not going to be allowed, Mr. President. An individual has to be either in the party-list or running in a district. If a person is in the party-list, he is not allowed to run in the district as an individual candidate of that party in the district.<br><br>Senator Tatad. Thank you very much for that answer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote>Unlike the prohibition pertaining to candidates who lost in the immediately preceding elections, the prohibition for candidates running in the same election to be included in the list of party-list nominees is supported by, and is consistent with, Section 73 of <i>Batas Pambansa Bilang</i> 881, otherwise known as the "<i>Omnibus Election Code</i>." The provision bars the filing of certificates of candidacy for more than one position in the same elections, thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 73. Certificate of candidacy. &#8212; No person shall be eligible for any elective public office unless he files a sworn certificate of candidacy within the period fixed herein.<br><br>A person who has filed a certificate of candidacy may, prior to the election, withdraw the same by submitting to the office concerned a written declaration under oath.<br><br>No person shall be eligible for more than one office to be filled in the same election, and if he files his certificate of candidacy for more than one office, he shall not be eligible for any of them. However, before the expiration of the period for the filing of certificates of candidacy, the person who was filed more than one certificate of candidacy may declare under oath the office for which he desires to be eligible and cancel the certificate of candidacy for the other office or offices.<br><br>The filing or withdrawal of a certificate of candidacy shall not affect whatever civil, criminal or administrative liabilities which a candidate may have incurred. (Sec. 19, 1978 EC)</blockquote>While the provision may have not taken into consideration the unique manner by which party-list candidates are nominated and later elected, the wisdom behind the provision very much applies to the party-list system. Under the party-list system, in lieu of a certificate of candidacy, the names of nominees are included in a certificate of nomination, while such nominee is required to file a corresponding certificate of acceptance of nomination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> In any case, where a certificate of candidacy has already been filed by an individual for any elective office, his/her nomination for a party-list should no longer be allowed. This must be so for as already discussed, it is the nominee, should the party-list win, who will sit as a member of the House of Representatives. Such a person cannot be allowed to represent two different constituents. Thus, the prohibition on this part was properly covered by the phrase "The list shall not include any candidate for any elective office" under Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941.<br><br>A final word. It cannot be overemphasized that the party-list system, as a significant constitutional innovation, deserves full endorsement of the judiciary and must be protected at all costs. As a mechanism, it ensures the preservation of our democracy by giving voice to the people, making them lawmakers themselves. In this relation, Congress is empowered to enact legislation to provide for the qualifications of party-list nominees who would eventually sit as representatives and members of the House. Be that as it may, any provision introduced therein should not be arbitrary and oppressive to the point of contravening the due process and equal protection clause enshrined in the 1987 Constitution.

No. 7941 prohibits "<i>a person who has lost his bid for an elective office in the immediately preceding election</i>" from becoming a party-list nominee, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>Section 8.</b> <i>Nomination of Party-List Representatives</i>.

Incumbent sectoral representatives in the House of Representatives who are nominated in the party-list system shall not be considered resigned. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In affirming the legislative power to provide additional qualifications for party-list representatives, the <i>ponencia</i> cites as authority Article VI, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution, which pertinently provides thus: "those who, <b><i>as provided by law</i></b>, shall be elected through a party-list system[.]" The <i>ponencia</i> concludes that Congress was explicitly delegated by the Constitution to determine the mechanics of the party-list system, and with it, the qualification of party-list representatives and the conduct for their nominations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The <i>ponencia</i> likewise distinguishes between the ruling in the instant case and that in <i>Social Justice Society v.

It was concluded, thus:<br><blockquote>It ought to be made abundantly clear ... that the unconstitutionality of Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165 is rooted on its having infringed the constitutional provision defining the qualification or eligibility requirements for one aspiring to run for and serve as senator.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>It bears acknowledging, however, that Philippine law may not have completely subscribed to this school of thought. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><strong><em>Qualifications under the Philippine context</em></strong></div></td><td width="70%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>In the Philippine context, the 1987 Constitution specifies the qualifications for national elective officials as well as members of constitutional commissions and offices. As regards the members of the House of Representatives, Article VI, Section 6<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Constitution enumerates the eligibility requirements that apply to both types of its members - <i>district</i> and <i>party-list</i> representatives. On top of these eligibility requirements (<i>i.e.</i>, age, residence, literacy, etc.), the Constitution in its various provisions also specifies disqualifications (or negative qualifications), such as term limits, and disqualification due to impeachment, among others.<br><br>However, in contrast to the American constitutional framework, and as the <i>ponencia</i> correctly observed, Article VI, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution authorizes the legislature to add to the constitutionally prescribed qualifications as regards party-list representatives, which it refers to as "those who, <b>as provided by law</b>, shall be elected through a party-list system[.]" Such language means that, in the <i>ponencia</i>'s words, "much room is accorded to Congress in determining <i>who</i> shall be elected as party-list representatives."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Moreover, even under the previous regime, the 1973 Constitution allowed other qualifications of the then sectoral representatives to be "provided by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On the statutory plane, additional qualifications for national elective positions have been implemented. For one, the Omnibus Election Code (<i>OEC</i>) provides disqualifications for all candidates under Sections 12 and 68,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> as shown below:<br><blockquote>Section 12. <i>Disqualifications</i>. &#8211; <u>Any person</u> who has been declared by competent authority <b>insane or incompetent</b>, or has been <b>sentenced by final judgment</b> for <b>subversion, insurrection, rebellion</b> or for <b>any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months</b> or for a <b>crime involving moral turpitude</b>, shall be <u>disqualified to be a candidate</u> and <u>to hold any office</u>, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty[.]<br><br>Section 68. <i>Disqualifications</i>. &#8211; Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party is <b>declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of</b>, or <b>found by the Commission</b> of having (<i>a</i>) given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions; (<i>b</i>) committed acts of terrorism to enhance his candidacy; (<i>c</i>) spent in his election campaign an amount in excess of that allowed by this Code; (<i>d</i>) solicited, received or made any contribution prohibited under Sections 89, 95, 96, 97 and 104; or (<i>e</i>) violated any of Sections 80, 83, 85, 86 and 261, paragraphs d, e, k, v, and cc, subparagraph 6, shall be <u>disqualified from continuing as a candidate, or if he has been elected, from holding the office</u>. Any person who is a <b>permanent resident of or an immigrant to a foreign country</b> shall not be qualified to run for any elective office under this Code, unless said person has waived his status as permanent resident or immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the residence requirement provided for in the election laws. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Moreover, the assailed provision in this case, Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941, also adds a statutory disqualification specific to party-list representatives (<i>i.e.</i>, lost the bid for an elective post in the last election).<br><br>Section 57(a) of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service provides that the penalty of dismissal from service for serious administrative charges carries with it "<b><i>perpetual disqualification from holding public office</i></b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Previously, Philippine case law subscribed to the condonation doctrine, which was sourced from U.S. law, such that an elective official cannot be removed from office for a misconduct committed during a prior term. Recently, the Court categorically abandoned<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> such doctrine not only for lack of legal basis but also for being rendered obsolete by the public accountability standard under the prevailing framework of the 1987 Constitution. Hence, being found guilty of a serious administrative offense committed during a prior term also gives rise to one's disqualification from being elected.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, the legal framework in the Philippines does not seem to strictly adhere to the philosophy of exclusive constitutional qualifications, as espoused by the framers of the U.S. Constitution and established in U.S. jurisprudence. Indeed, our framework has long departed from its foreign counterpart. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><em><strong>Guideline as regards constitutionality of additional qualifications under statutes</strong></em></div></td><td width="70%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>In my humble view, there is considerable value in retaining the exclusivity of the constitutionally prescribed qualifications. Indeed, limiting the qualifications of candidates running for congressional posts to those explicitly provided under the Constitution is a way of preventing, in the words of James Madison, a republic from being converted into "an aristocracy or oligarchy" "by limiting the number [of persons] capable of being elected."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In line with the principles of a republican government, "no qualification of wealth, of birth, of religious faith, or of civil profession"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> may be added by Congress to the list of constitutional qualifications.<br><br>Further, there are disqualifications provided under our statutes that correspond to the inability of a candidate to eventually fulfill his duties should such candidate be elected, such as those provided in Section 12 of the OEC (<i>i.e.</i>, insane or incompetent, or sentenced by final judgment for the listed crimes against public order, or for an offense penalized by more than eighteen months, or for a crime involving moral turpitude). There are also disqualifications that further strengthen the disciplinary and public accountability framework under the Article XI of the Constitution; particularly, disqualification from holding public office after being found administratively liable for serious misconduct that warrants dismissal from service.<br><br>On these scores, it is my view that <b>any additional qualification</b> for congressional posts must <b>find anchor on a constitutional principle, or</b> at the very least, <b>have bearing on the fitness of the candidate to serve the electorate</b>. This guiding principle will assist the Court in ascertaining the constitutionality of any prescribed qualification in addition to those already listed under the Constitution. Otherwise, if the additional qualification to be provided by law is completely irrelevant to the fitness of the candidate to discharge his/her function under the Constitution, then such additional qualification would be unconstitutional.<br><br>It is my hope that the disquisition above will guide the Court in resolving cases involving the validity of qualifications added by statute to those constitutionally prescribed for congressional positions. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><strong><em>Rational basis test; non-fundamental right</em></strong></div></td><td width="70%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>As regards the applicable test to determine the constitutionality of the assailed provision, the <i>ponencia</i> correctly applies the rational basis test because, as accurately pointed out by Justices Alfredo Benjamin S.

In its Resolution in <i>Quinto v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court overturned its previous finding that the right to run for public office is linked to the fundamental rights of expression and association, to wit:<br><blockquote>[O]ur assailed Decision's submission that the right to run for public office is "inextricably linked" with two fundamental freedoms &#8212; those of expression and association &#8212; lies on barren ground. American case law has in fact <b>never recognized a fundamental right to express one's political views through candidacy, as to invoke a rigorous standard of review</b>. <i>Bart v.

Thus, one's interest in seeking office, <b>by itself</b>, is <b>not</b> entitled to constitutional protection. Moreover, one cannot bring one's action under the rubric of freedom of association, absent any allegation that, by running for an elective position, one is advancing the political ideas of a particular set of voters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphases in the original; citations omitted)</blockquote>To emphasize, the Court in <i>Quinto</i> firmly pronounced that the supposed link between the right to run for public office, on one hand, and the fundamental rights of expression and association, on the other, "<i>lies on barren ground</i>." A careful reading of the Resolution shows that the Court <b>explicitly declared the non-fundamental character</b> of the <b>right to seek elective office</b>, thus:<br><blockquote>Prescinding from these premises, it is crystal clear that the provisions challenged in the case at bar, are not violative of the equal protection clause. The deemed-resigned provisions substantially serve governmental interests (<i>i.e.</i>, (i) efficient civil service faithful to the government and the people rather than to party; (ii) avoidance of the appearance of "political justice" as to policy; (iii) avoidance of the danger of a powerful political machine; and (iv) ensuring that employees achieve advancement on their merits and that they be free from both coercion and the prospect of favor from political activity). These are interests that are important enough to outweigh the <b>non-fundamental right</b> of appointive officials and employees <b>to seek elective office</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>Indeed, while the right to run for public office has been recognized in this jurisdiction, such right does not rise to the level of a fundamental right as to trigger the application of the strict scrutiny test.<br><br>As Justice Caguioa aptly points out, there is no precise definition or enumeration of fundamental rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Indeed, while there is little debate that those guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, especially those mirrored in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are of fundamental nature,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> other rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution have also been declared to be of such stature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> On this point, I echo Justice Francis Jardaleza's call for the Court to "endeavor to be deliberate and open about its choice of approach in fundamental rights cases."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> To my mind, while there are no clear guidelines yet in Our jurisdiction on the methods of identifying implied fundamental rights, the Court should remain cautious and guard itself against loosely characterizing certain rights as fundamental in character.

Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by <b>enhancing their chances</b> to <b>compete for and win seats in the legislature</b>, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>Unquestionably, there is a legitimate government interest in creating a party-&shy;list system that enables citizens from the "marginalized and underrepresented" to be legislators despite them not having "well-defined political constituencies." The party-list system is institutionalized precisely to benefit those who may not win in other elective posts due to their financial limitations and ostensibly marginal position in society, even though they are willing and well-equipped to contribute in the crafting of meaningful legislation. The noble purpose of the law is precisely to "enhance the chances" of these citizens to win legislative seats.<br><br>This brings us to the question whether there is a <i>reasonable connection</i> between the stated government purpose and the means employed to achieve it. In this case, the means employed is the statutorily-imposed disqualification of "a person who has lost his bid for an elective office in the immediately preceding election" from becoming a party-list nominee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this case, the rationale given to justify the assailed prohibition is "to limit, discourage, and disallow the abuse of the party-list system as a fallback measure for traditional politicians to serve in an elective post."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>To my mind, no <i>reasonable connection</i> was established between the purpose of the statute and the disqualification imposed on those who lost in the last elections. The supposed "abuse of the party-list system" is not squarely addressed by prohibiting those who lost in the previous election from becoming a party-list nominee. If at all, it even puts them at a disadvantage and perpetuates the non-inclusivity sought to be avoided by the party-list system. Discriminating against those who lost in the immediately preceding elections <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> those who either (<i>a</i>) have not participated in any election or (<i>b</i>) have won in the previous elections for a party-list seat or for a different elective office,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> does not serve to fulfill the stated legitimate government interest.<br><br>Contrary to the expressed purpose of the statute, the "chances" of those candidates who may not have the political machinery to win the elections but are competent to craft, scrutinize, and pass impactful legislation, are not "enhanced." Indeed, the exclusion of such persons from becoming nominees does not serve to advance the State's policy to give representation to the "marginalized and underrepresented" and "enhance their chances" to win a legislative seat.<br><br>Bearing in mind the inclusivity principle as the rationale for the introduction of the party-list system in our government structure, I emphatically concur with the <i>ponencia</i> in finding no rational basis for the "classification treating losing candidates in the immediately preceding election differently from" candidates who either won or did not participate in such election.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>All told, I concur with the <i>ponencia</i> in declaring that the assailed provisions that disqualify "<i>a person who has lost his bid for an elective office in the immediately preceding election</i>" from becoming a party-list nominee, as constitutionally infirm.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petitions.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Entitled "AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE ELECTION OF PARTY-LIST REPRESENTATIVES THROUGH THE PARTY-LIST SYSTEM, AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR."

Once this Court determines that the procedural vehicle employed by the parties raises issues on matters within its legal competence, it may then decide whether to adjudicate the constitutional issues brought before it.<br><br>Jurisdiction alone will not require this Court to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute. As held in <i>Angara v. Electoral Commission</i>, the power of judicial review remains subject to this Court's discretion in resolving actual controversies:<br><blockquote>[W]hen the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an <i>actual controversy</i> the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them. This is in truth all that is involved in what is termed "judicial supremacy" which properly is the power of judicial review under the Constitution. <i>Even then, this power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument by the parties, and limited further to the constitutional question raised or the very lis mota presented.</i> Any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation.

These requisites all relate to the justiciability of the issues raised by the parties. If no justiciable controversy is found, this Court may deny the petition as a matter of discretion.<br><br>This justiciability requirement is "intertwined with the principle of separation of powers." It cautions the judiciary against unnecessary intrusion on matters committed to the other branches of the government.<br><br>....<br><br>Again, <b>jurisdiction in itself will not automatically merit a ruling on the constitutionality of the assailed provisions. Invocations of "transcendental importance" will not affect this Court's competence to decide the issues before it, and raising this Court's competence to decide issues of constitutionality will not necessarily require it to do so.

To possess legal standing, parties must show "a personal and substantial interest in the case such that [they have] sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged." The requirement of direct injury guarantees that the party who brings suit has such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy and, in effect, assures "that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions."<br><br>The requirements of legal standing and the recently discussed actual case and controversy are both "built on the principle of separation of powers, sparing as it does unnecessary interference or invalidation by the judicial branch of the actions rendered by its co-equal branches of government." In addition, economic reasons justify the rule. Thus:<br><blockquote>A lesser but not insignificant reason for screening the standing of persons who desire to litigate constitutional issues is economic in character. Given the sparseness of our resources, the capacity of courts to render efficient judicial service to our people is severely limited. For courts to indiscriminately open their doors to all types of suits and suitors is for them to unduly overburden their dockets, and ultimately render themselves ineffective dispensers of justice. To be sure, this is an evil that clearly confronts our judiciary today.</blockquote>Standing in private suits requires that actions be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party-in-interest, interest being "material interest or an interest in issue to be affected by the decree or judgment of the case[,] [not just] mere curiosity about the question involved." Whether a suit is public or private, the parties must have "a present substantial interest," not a "mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest."

The right to equal protection of the laws enshrined in our Constitution requires that all persons, under similar circumstances and conditions, shall be treated alike:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote>The equal protection of the law clause is against undue favor and individual or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the oppression of inequality. It is not intended to prohibit legislation, which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by territory within which it is to operate. It does not demand absolute equality among residents; it merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, <i>under like circumstances and conditions</i> both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced. The equal protection clause is not infringed by legislation which applies only to those persons falling within a specified class, if it applies alike to all persons within such class, and reasonable grounds exists for making a distinction between those who fall within such class and those who do not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>The equal protection of the laws, however, do not prohibit legal classification, provided there is reasonable classification: (1) based on substantial distinctions which make for real differences; (2) germane to the purpose of the law; (3) not limited to existing conditions only; and (4) applicable equally to each member of the same class, thus:<br><blockquote>The guaranty of equal protection of the laws is not a guaranty of equality in the application of the laws upon all citizens of the state. It is not, therefore, a requirement, in order to avoid the constitutional prohibition against inequality, that every man, woman and child should be affected alike by a statute. Equality of operation of statutes does not mean indiscriminate operation on persons merely as such, but on persons according to the circumstances surrounding them. It guarantees equality, not identity of rights. The Constitution does not require that things which are different in fact be treated in law as though they were the same. The equal protection clause does not forbid discrimination as to things that are different. It does not prohibit legislation which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate.<br><br>The equal protection of the laws clause of the Constitution allows classification. Classification in law, as in the other departments of knowledge or practice, is the grouping of things in speculation or practice because they agree with one another in certain particulars. A law is not invalid because of simple inequality. The very idea of classification is that of inequality, so that it goes without saying that the mere fact of inequality in no manner determines the matter of constitutionality. <b>All that is required of a valid classification is that it be reasonable, which means that the classification should be based on substantial distinctions which make for real differences; that it must be germane to the purpose of the law; that it must not be limited to existing conditions only; and that it must apply equally to each member of the class. This Court has held that the standard is satisfied if the classification or distinction is based on a reasonable foundation or rational basis and is not palpably arbitrary.</b><br><br>In the exercise of its power to make classifications for the purpose of enacting laws over matters within its jurisdiction, the state is recognized as enjoying a wide range of discretion. It is not necessary that the classification be based on scientific or marked differences of things or in their relation. <b>Neither is it necessary that the classification be made with mathematical nicety. Hence legislative classification may in many cases properly rest on narrow distinctions, for the equal protection guaranty does not preclude the legislature from recognizing degrees of evil or harm, and legislation is addressed to evils as they may appear.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote>The legislature is granted wide leeway in providing classification, as long as it is not unreasonable and unfounded:<br><blockquote><b>Some may disagree with the wisdom of the legislature's classification. To this we answer, that this is the prerogative of the law-making power.</b> Since the Court finds that the classification is actual, real and reasonable, and all persons of one class are treated alike, and as it cannot be said that the classification is patently unreasonable and unfounded, it is in duty bound to declare that the legislature acted within its legitimate prerogative and it cannot declare that the act transcends the limit of equal protection established by the Constitution.<br><br><b>Broadly speaking, the power of the legislature to make distinctions and classifications among persons is not curtailed or denied by the equal protection of the laws clause.

The need for new blood assumes relevance. The tiredness of the retiree for government work is present, and what is emphatically significant is that the retired employee has already declared himself tired and unavailable for the same government work, but, which, by virtue of a change of mind, he would like to assume again. It is for the very reason that inequality will neither result from the application of the challenged provision. Just as that provision does not deny equal protection, neither does it permit such denial. Persons similarly situated are similarly treated.<br><br>In fine, it bears reiteration that the equal protection clause does not forbid all legal classification. What it proscribes is a classification which is arbitrary and unreasonable. That constitutional guarantee is not violated by a reasonable classification based upon substantial distinctions, where the classification is germane to the purpose of the law and applies to all those belonging to the same class. The purpose of the law is to allow the emergence of younger blood in local governments. <b>The classification in question being pursuant to that purpose, it cannot be considered invalid "even if at times, it may be susceptible to the objection that it is marred by theoretical inconsistencies.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote>In <i>Fari&ntilde;as v.

The former occupy their office by virtue of the mandate of the electorate. They are elected to an office for a definite term and may be removed therefrom only upon stringent conditions. On the other hand, appointive officials hold their office by virtue of their designation thereto by an appointing authority. Some appointive officials hold their office in a permanent capacity and are entitled to security of tenure while others serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority.<br><br>Another substantial distinction between the two sets of officials is that under Section 55, Chapter 8, Title I, Subsection A. Civil Service Commission, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292), appointive officials, as officers and employees in the civil service, are strictly prohibited from engaging in any partisan political activity or take part in any election except to vote. Under the same provision, elective officials, or officers or employees holding political offices, are obviously expressly allowed to take part in political and electoral activities.<br><br>By repealing Section 67 but retaining Section 66 of the Omnibus Election Code, the legislators deemed it proper to treat these two classes of officials differently with respect to the effect on their tenure in the office of the filing of the certificates of candidacy for any position other than those occupied by them. <b>Again, it is not within the power of the Court to pass upon or look into the wisdom of this classification.</b><br><br>Since the classification justifying Section 14 of Rep. Act No. 9006, <i>i.e.</i>, elected officials <i>vis-a-vis</i> appointive officials, is anchored upon material and significant distinctions and all the persons belonging under the same classification are similarly treated, the equal protection clause of the Constitution is, thus, not infringed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Over time, three tests of judicial scrutiny were developed to determine reasonableness of classification:<br><blockquote>Philippine jurisprudence has developed three (3) tests of judicial scrutiny to determine the reasonableness of classifications. The <b>strict scrutiny test</b> applies when a classification either (<i>i</i>) interferes with the exercise of fundamental rights, including the basic liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, or (<i>ii</i>) burdens suspect classes. The <b>intermediate scrutiny test</b> applies when a classification does not involve suspect classes or fundamental rights, but requires heightened scrutiny, such as in classifications based on gender and legitimacy.

In accordance with <i>White Light</i>, "the availability of less restrictive measures [must have been] considered."

It is enough that the means employed is conceptually the least restrictive mechanism that the government may apply.<br><br>Strict scrutiny applies when what is at stake are fundamental freedoms or what is involved are suspect classifications. It requires that there be a compelling state interest and that the means employed to effect it are narrowly-tailored, actually &#8212; not only conceptually &#8212; being the least restrictive means for effecting the invoked interest. Here, it does not suffice that the government contemplated on the means available to it. Rather, it must show an active effort at demonstrating the inefficacy of all possible alternatives. Here, it is required to not only explore all possible avenues but to even debunk the viability of alternatives so as to ensure that its chosen course of action is the sole effective means.

The duties imposed by the "mandate of the people" are multifarious. The accused-appellant asserts that the duty to legislate ranks highest in the hierarchy of government. The accused-appellant is only one of 250 members of the House of Representatives, not to mention the 24 members of the Senate, charged with the duties of legislation. Congress continues to function well in the physical absence of one or a few of its members. Depending on the exigency of Government that has to be addressed, the President or the Supreme Court can also be deemed the highest for that particular duty. The importance of a function depends on the need for its exercise. The duty of a mother to nurse her infant is most compelling under the law of nature. A doctor with unique skills has the duty to save the lives of those with a particular affliction. An elective governor has to serve provincial constituents. A police officer must maintain peace and order. Never has the call of a particular duty lifted a prisoner into a different classification from those others who are validly restrained by law.<br><br><b>A strict scrutiny of classifications is essential lest wittingly or otherwise, insidious discriminations are made in favor of or against groups or types of individuals.</b><br><br>The Court cannot validate badges of inequality. The necessities imposed by public welfare may justify exercise of government authority to regulate even if thereby certain groups may plausibly assert that their interests are disregarded.<br><br>We, therefore, find that election to the position of Congressman is not a reasonable classification in criminal law enforcement. The functions and duties of the office are not substantial distinctions which lift him from the class of prisoners interrupted in their freedom and restricted in liberty of movement.

It was precisely designed to facilitate the conduct of orderly, honest, and credible elections by containing &#8212; if not eliminating, the perennial problem of having flying voters, as well as dead and multiple registrants. According to the sponsorship speech of Senator Aquilino L. Pimentel III, the objective of the law was to cleanse the national voter registry so as to eliminate electoral fraud and ensure that the results of the elections were truly reflective of the genuine will of the people. The foregoing consideration is unquestionably a compelling state interest.<br><br>Also, it was shown that the regulation is the least restrictive means for achieving the above-said interest. Section 6 of Resolution No. 9721 sets the procedure for biometrics validation, whereby the registered voter is only required to: (<i>a</i>) personally appear before the Office of the Election Officer; (<i>b</i>) present a competent evidence of identity; and (<i>c</i>) have his photo, signature, and fingerprints recorded. It is, in effect, a manner of updating one's registration for those already registered under RA 8189, or a first-time registration for new registrants. The re-registration process is amply justified by the fact that the government is adopting a novel technology like biometrics in order to address the bane of electoral fraud that has enduringly plagued the electoral exercises in this country. While registrants may be inconvenienced by waiting in long lines or by not being accommodated on certain days due to heavy volume of work, these are typical burdens of voting that are remedied by bureaucratic improvements to be implemented by the COMELEC as an administrative institution. By and large, the COMELEC has not turned a blind eye to these realities. It has tried to account for the exigencies by holding continuous registration as early as May 6, 2014 until October 31, 2015, or for over a period of 18 months. To make the validation process as convenient as possible, the COMELEC even went to the extent of setting up off-site and satellite biometrics registration in shopping malls and conducted the same on Sundays. Moreover, it deserves mentioning that RA 10367 and Resolution No. 9721 did not mandate registered voters to submit themselves to validation every time there is an election. In fact, it only required the voter to undergo the validation process one (1) time, which shall remain effective in succeeding elections, provided that he remains an active voter. To add, the failure to validate did not preclude deactivated voters from exercising their right to vote in the succeeding elections. To rectify such status, they could still apply for reactivation following the procedure laid down in Section 28 of RA 8189.<br><br>That being said, the assailed regulation on the right to suffrage was sufficiently justified as it was indeed narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest of establishing a clean, complete, permanent and updated list of voters, and was demonstrably the least restrictive means in promoting that interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The strict scrutiny test has also been used when the regulation involves a "suspect class" defined as "a class saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In <i>Central Bank v.

Oppressive acts will be struck down regardless of the character or nature of the actor.<br><br>....<br><br>In the case at bar, the challenged proviso operates on the basis of the salary grade or officer-employee status. <i>It is akin to a distinction based on economic class and status</i>, with the higher grades as recipients of a benefit specifically withheld from the lower grades.

The implications are quite disturbing: BSP rank-&shy;and-file employees are paid the strictly regimented rates of the SSL while employees higher in rank &#8212; possessing higher and better education and opportunities for career advancement &#8212; are given higher compensation packages to entice them to stay. <i>Considering that majority, if not all, the rank-and-file employees consist of people whose status and rank in life are less and limited, especially in terms of job marketability, it is they &#8212; and not the officers &#8212; who have the real economic and financial need for the adjustment.</i> This is in accord with the policy of the Constitution "to free the people from poverty, provide adequate social services, extend to them a decent standard of living, and improve the quality of life for all." <i>Any act of Congress that runs counter to this constitutional desideratum deserves strict scrutiny by this Court before if can pass muster.</i><br><br>To be sure, the <i>BSP rank-and-file employees merit greater concern from this Court</i>. They represent the more impotent rank-and-file government employees who, unlike employees in the private sector, have no specific right to organize as a collective bargaining unit and negotiate for better terms and conditions of employment, nor the power to hold a strike to protest unfair labor practices. Not only are they impotent as a labor unit, but their efficacy to lobby in Congress is almost nil as R.A. No. 7653 effectively isolated them from the other GFI rank-and-file in compensation. <i>These BSP rank-and-file employees represent the politically powerless and they should not be compelled to seek a political solution to their unequal and iniquitous treatment.</i> Indeed, they have waited for many years for the legislature to act. They cannot be asked to wait some more for discrimination cannot be given any waiting time. Unless the equal protection clause of the Constitution is a mere platitude, it is the Court's duty to save them from reasonless discrimination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>In <i>Sameer Overseas Placement Agency, Inc. v.

This premise is best explained in <i>Mancuso v. Taft</i>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Freedom of expression guarantees to the individual the opportunity to write a letter to the local newspaper, speak out in a public park, distribute handbills advocating radical reform, or picket an official building to seek redress of grievances. All of these activities are protected by the First Amendment if done in a manner consistent with a narrowly defined concept of public order and safety. The choice of means will likely depend on the amount of time and energy the individual wishes to expend and on his perception as to the most effective method of projecting his message to the public. But interest and commitment are evolving phenomena. What is an effective means for protest at one point in time may not seem so effective at a later date. The dilettante who participates in a picket line may decide to devote additional time and resources to his expressive activity. As his commitment increases, the means of effective expression changes, but the expressive quality remains constant. He may decide to lead the picket line, or to publish the newspaper. At one point in time he may decide that the most effective way to give expression to his views and to get the attention of an appropriate audience is to become a candidate for public office-means generally considered among the most appropriate for those desiring to effect change in our governmental systems. He may seek to become a candidate by filing in a general election as an independent or by seeking the nomination of a political party. And in the latter instance, the individual's expressive activity has two dimensions: besides urging that his views be the views of the elected public official, he is also attempting to become a spokesman for a political party whose substantive program extends beyond the particular office in question. But Cranston has said that a certain type of its citizenry, the public employee, may not become a candidate and may not engage in any campaign activity that promotes himself as a candidate for public office. Thus the city has stifled what may be the most important expression an individual can summon, namely that which he would be willing to effectuate, by means of concrete public action, were he to be selected by the voters.<br><br>It is impossible to ignore the additional fact that the right to run for office also affects the freedom to associate. In <i>Williams v. Rhodes, supra</i>, the Court used strict review to invalidate an Ohio election system that made it virtually impossible for third parties to secure a place on the ballot. The Court found that the First Amendment protected the freedom to associate by forming and promoting a political party and that that freedom was infringed when the state effectively denied a party access to its electoral machinery. The Cranston charter provision before us also affects associational rights, albeit in a slightly different way. An individual may decide to join or participate in an organization or political party that shares his beliefs. He may even form a new group to forward his ideas. And at some juncture his supporters and fellow party members may decide that he is the ideal person to carry the group's standard into the electoral fray. To thus restrict the options available to political organization as the Cranston charter provision has done is to limit the effectiveness of association; and the freedom to associate is intimately related with the concept of making expression effective. Party access to the ballot becomes less meaningful if some of those selected by party machinery to carry the party's programs to the people are precluded from doing so because those nominees are civil servants.<br><br>Whether the right to run for office is looked at from the point of view of individual expression or associational effectiveness, wide opportunities exist for the individual who seeks public office. The fact of candidacy alone may open previously closed doors of the media. The candidate may be invited to discuss his views on radio talk shows; he may be able to secure equal time on television to elaborate his campaign program; the newspapers may cover his candidacy; he may be invited to debate before various groups that had theretofore never heard of him or his views. In short, the fact of candidacy opens up a variety of communicative possibilities that are not available to even the most diligent of picketers or the most loyal of party followers. A view today, that running for public office is not an interest protected by the First Amendment, seems to us an outlook stemming from an earlier era when public office was the preserve of the professional and the wealthy. Consequently we hold that candidacy is both a protected First Amendment right and a fundamental interest. Hence any legislative classification that significantly burdens that interest must be subjected to strict equal protection review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote>To democratize political power and give chance to political parties that cannot win in legislative district elections, the Constitution provides for the party-list system, and corollary, gives the voter the right to elect two representatives in the House of Representatives&#8212;one for his or her legislative district and another for his or her party-list group.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Undisputedly, there are substantial distinctions between a district representative or party-list representative, as clearly provided for in the Constitution:<br><blockquote><center>Article VI</center><br>SECTION 5.

A democratic and republican state is founded on effective representation. It is also founded on the idea that <b>it is the electorate's choices that must be given full consideration</b>. We must always be sensitive in our crafting of doctrines lest the guardians of our electoral system be empowered to silence those who wish to offer their representation. We cannot replace the needed experience of our people to mature as citizen in our electorate.<br><br>....<br><br>There are two types of representatives in the House of Representatives. Those in the first group are "elected from legislative districts". Those in the second group are "elected through a party list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties and organizations."<br><br>The differences in terms of representation are clear.<br><br>Those who are elected from legislative districts will have their name in the ballot. They present their persons as the potential agent of their electorate. It is their individual qualifications that will be assessed by COMELEC on the basis of the Constitution and relevant statutes. Should there be disqualification it would be their personal circumstances, which will be reviewed, in the proper case, by the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET). The individual representative can lose subsequent elections for various reasons, including dissatisfaction from those that initially elected him/her into office.<br><br>Incidentally, those who present themselves for election by legislative districts may or may not be supported by a registered political party. This may give them added political advantages in the electoral exercise, which includes the goodwill, reputation and resources of the major political party they affiliate with. However, it is not the nature of the political party that endorses them that is critical in assessing the qualifications or disqualifications of the candidate.<br><br><b>The elected district representative in the House of Representative is directly accountable to his/her electorate.</b> The political party s/he affiliates with only shares that political accountability; but, only to a certain extent. Good performance is usually rewarded with subsequent election to another term. <b>It is the elected representative, not the political party that will get re-elected.</b> We can even take judicial notice that party affiliation may change in subsequent elections for various reasons, without any effect on the qualification of the elected representative.<br><br>The political party that affiliates those who participate in elections in legislative districts organize primarily to have their candidates win. These political parties have avowed principles and platforms of government. But, they will be known more through the personalities and popularity of their candidates. Often, compromises occur in the political party's philosophies in order to accommodate a viable candidate.<br><br>This has been the usual role of political parties even before the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><b>The party list system is an attempt to introduce a new system of politics in our country, one where voters choose platforms and principles primarily</b> and candidate-nominees secondarily. As provided in the Constitution, the party list system's intentions are broader than simply to "ensure that those who are marginalized and represented become lawmakers themselves".<br><br>Historically, our electoral exercises privileged the popular and, perhaps, pedigreed individual candidate over platforms and political programs. Political parties were convenient amalgamation of electoral candidates from the national to the local level that gravitated towards a few of its leaders who could marshall the resources to supplement the electoral campaigns of their members. Most elections were choices between competing personalities often with very little discernible differences in their interpretation and solutions for contemporary issues. The electorate chose on the bases of personality and popularity; only after the candidates were elected to public offices will they later find out the concrete political programs that the candidate will execute. Our history is replete with instances where the programs that were executed lacked cohesion on the basis of principle. In a sense, our electoral politics alienated and marginalized large parts of our population.<br><br>The party list system was introduced to challenge the status quo. It could not have been intended to enhance and further entrench the same system. <b>It is the party or the organization that is elected. It is the party list group that authorizes, hopefully through a democratic process, a priority list of its nominees. It is also the party list group that can delist or remove their nominees, and hence replace him or her, should he or she act inconsistently with the avowed principles and platforms of governance of their organization. In short, the party list system assists genuine political parties to evolve. Genuine political parties enable true representation, and hence, provide the potential for us to realize a "democratic and republican state".</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote>The party-list system envisions genuine political parties to evolve in order to achieve effective representation in the Congress and in effect, help the nation realize being a "democratic and republican state."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It aims to give representation and expression of interests and advocacies, which may not be within the main focus of those who represent legislative districts:<br><blockquote>It is the nurturing ground to mature genuine political parties and give them the experience and the ability to build constituencies for other elective public offices.<br><br>In a sense, challenging the politics of personality by constitutionally entrenching the ability of political parties and organizations to instill party discipline can redound to the benefit of those who have been marginalized and underrepresented in the past.

It encourages more collective action by the membership of the party and hence will reduce the possibility that the party be controlled only by a select few.<br><br>Thus, it is not only "for the marginalized and underrepresented in our midst ... who wallow in poverty, destitution and infirmity" that the party list system was enacted.

Allowing them space in the House of Representatives if they have the constituency that can win them a seat will enrich the deliberations in that legislative chamber.

Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this Court held that the State could exclude nuisance candidates, or those candidates who have not evinced a <i>bona fide</i> intention to run for office, due to the compelling interest to ensure that the electoral exercises are rational, objective, orderly, and credible:<br><blockquote>The rationale behind the prohibition against nuisance candidates and the disqualification of candidates who have not evinced a <i>bona fide</i> intention to run for office is easy to divine. The State has a compelling interest to ensure that its electoral exercises are rational, objective, and orderly. Towards this end, the State takes into account the practical considerations in conducting elections. Inevitably, the greater the number of candidates, the greater the opportunities for logistical confusion, not to mention the increased allocation of time and resources in preparation for the election. These practical difficulties should, of course, never exempt the State from the conduct of a mandated electoral exercise. At the same time, remedial actions should be available to alleviate these logistical hardships, whenever necessary and proper. Ultimately, a disorderly election is not merely a textbook example of inefficiency, but a rot that erodes faith in our democratic institutions. As the United States Supreme Court held:<br><br>[T]here is surely an important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization and its candidates on the ballot &#8212; the interest, if no other, in avoiding confusion, deception and even frustration of the democratic [process].<br><br>....<br><br>Given these considerations, the ignominious nature of a nuisance candidacy becomes even more galling. The organization of an election with <i>bona fide</i> candidates standing is onerous enough. To add into the mix candidates with no serious intentions or capabilities to run a viable campaign would actually impair the electoral process. This is not to mention the candidacies which are palpably ridiculous so as to constitute a one-note joke. The poll body would be bogged by irrelevant minutiae covering every step of the electoral process, most probably posed at the instance of these nuisance candidates. It would be a senseless sacrifice on the part of the State.<br><br>Owing to the superior interest in ensuring a credible and orderly election, the State could exclude nuisance candidates and need not indulge in, as the song goes, "their trips to the moon on gossamer wings."<br><br>The Omnibus Election Code and COMELEC Resolution No. 6452 are cognizant of the compelling State interest to ensure orderly and credible elections by excising impediments thereto, such as nuisance candidacies that distract and detract from the larger purpose. The COMELEC is mandated by the Constitution with the administration of elections and endowed with considerable latitude in adopting means and methods that will ensure the promotion of free, orderly and honest elections. Moreover, the Constitution guarantees that only bona fide candidates for public office shall be free from any form of harassment and discrimination. The determination of <i>bona fide</i> candidates is governed by the statutes, and the concept, to our mind is, satisfactorily defined in the Omnibus Election Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote>Similarly, in my view, persons who have lost their bid for elective office in the immediately preceding election should be excluded as nominees of their party-list, due to the State's compelling interest to "guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature" as stated in the policy statement of The Party-List System Act:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. &#8212; The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well&shy; defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible.</blockquote>Indeed, it is the policy of the State to broaden electoral opportunities and possible representation of interests in Congress, through the party-list system, such that even those who could not win in the legislative district elections will be given a fair chance to enter and to have a voice in Congress. Thus, those who lost in the previous elections are not necessarily prohibited from becoming party-list nominees, but only those who ran and lost in an elective office in the immediately preceding elections are singled out by the law. This is the least restrictive means for effecting the invoked compelling interest. As pointed out by respondent, through the Office of the Solicitor General, those who lost in the immediately preceding elections "will be more inclined to seek alternative ways to secure public office" and use the party&shy;-list as a mechanism to secure public office after having lost in such elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The <i>ponente</i> likewise pointed out that the purpose would be to limit, discourage, and disallow the abuse of the party-list system as a fallback measure for traditional politicians to serve in an elective position.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, to allow those persons who just ran and lost in the immediately preceding election to be nominated in the immediately succeeding election will patently run counter to the law's policy and intent, as it will be unlikely to enhance the "chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature."<br><br>Therefore, the assailed provision prohibiting a person who has lost his bid for elective office in the immediately preceding election from becoming a party-list nominee was sufficiently justified as it was indeed narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state interest of establishing "a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives" and was demonstrably the least restrictive means in promoting that interest&#8212;only those who lost in the immediately preceding election are prohibited from being nominated.<br><br>In any case, all reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a statute, being an act by the Legislature, approved by the Executive:<br><blockquote>This court is not unmindful of the fundamental criteria in cases of this nature that all reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a statute. An act of the legislature approved by the executive, is presumed to be within constitutional limitations. The responsibility of upholding the Constitution rests not on the courts alone but on the legislature as well. "The question of the validity of every statute is first determined by the legislative department of the government itself." And a statute finally comes before the courts sustained by the sanction of the executive. The members of the Legislature and the Chief Executive have taken an oath to support the Constitution and it must be presumed that they have been true to this oath and that in enacting and sanctioning a particular law they did not intend to violate the Constitution. <b>The courts cannot but cautiously exercise its power to overturn the solemn declarations of two of the three grand departments of the government.

The following exchange between Commissioners Soc Rodrigo and Christian S. Monsod enlightens:<br><blockquote>MR. RODRIGO. x x x In the light of the phrase "AS PROVIDED BY LAW," do I take it that this party list system and sectoral representation provision will not take effect until an enabling act or an implementing legislation shall have been enacted by Congress?<br><br>MR.

But <b>when we say, "AS PROVIDED BY LAW," it could really mean that it may be by ordinance appended to this constitution or an executive order by the incumbent President or, as the Gentleman has said, by law provided by the incoming Congress</b>. So, it could be any of these ways.<br><br>MR. RODRIGO. Madam President, we are all witnesses to the difficulty in arriving at a consensus of these very novel ideas on the disputes that we have had. And up to now, there is no real consensus yet. Does the Commissioner believe that we should really try to go into the details by enacting an ordinance to the Constitution? x x x<br><br>MR. MONSOD.

This evinces the intent of the framers to delegate the broad power of formulating rules operationalizing the party-list system, in the event that the same could not be made part of the Constitution.<br><br>As ratified, the 1987 Constitution only provides the manner of filling the seats reserved for sectoral representation, <i>i.e.</i>, by appointment of the President from a list of nominees by the respective sectors, "<i>until a law is passed</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, I agree that Congress, by express language of Section 5(1), is empowered to determine who shall be elected through the party-list system, and corollary thereto, to determine the qualifications of the party-list representatives elected under this system.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><strong><em>Any additional qualification provided by statute is subject to the general limitations on legislation, including the equal protection clause.

Nowhere in the Constitution does it unequivocally say so.<br><br>It may appear that Section 26, Article II of the 1987 Constitution grants otherwise when it provides, in part, that "[t]he State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service x x x." This, however, has already been settled or interpreted by the Court in the negative.<br><br>In <i>Timbol v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (<i>Timbol</i>), the Court declared that the guarantee under Article II, Section 26 of the 1987 Constitution is not a guarantee to a constitutional right to run for public office. To run for public office, it said, is a mere privilege subject to limitations imposed by law.<br><br><i>Timbol,</i> in turn, relied on an earlier case, <i>Rev. Pamatong v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (<i>Pamatong</i>), from which the foregoing disquisition came. The common issue in <i>Timbol</i> and <i>Pamatong</i> dwelled on whether nuisance candidates may be prohibited or excluded from participating in the elections, despite the existence of Section 26, Article II of the 1987 Constitution. Ruling in the affirmative, <i>Pamatong</i> elaborated on the validity of such prohibition in this way:<br><blockquote><b>Implicit in the petitioner's invocation of the constitutional provision ensuring "equal access to opportunities for public office" is the claim that there is a constitutional right to run for or hold public office and, particularly in his case, to seek the presidency. There is none. What is recognized is merely a privilege subject to limitations imposed by law. Section 26, Article II of the Constitution neither bestows such a right nor elevates the privilege to the level of an enforceable right. There is nothing in the plain language of the provision which suggests such a thrust or justifies an interpretation of the sort.</b><br><br>The "equal access" provision is a subsumed part of Article II of the Constitution, entitled "Declaration of Principles and State Policies." The provisions under the Article are generally considered not self-executing, and there is no plausible reason for according a different treatment to the "equal access" provision. Like the rest of the policies enumerated in Article II, the provision does not contain any judicially enforceable constitutional right but merely specifies a guideline for legislative or executive action. The disregard of the provision does not give rise to any cause of action before the courts.<br><br>An inquiry into the intent of the framers produces the same determination that the provision is not self-executory. The original wording of the present Section 26, Article II had read, "The State shall broaden opportunities to public office and prohibit public dynasties." Commissioner (now Chief Justice) Hilario Davide, Jr. successfully brought forth an amendment that changed the word "broaden" to the phrase "ensure equal access," and the substitution of the word "office" to "service." He explained his proposal in this wise:<br><blockquote>I changed the word "broaden" to "ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO" because what is important would be equal access to the opportunity. <i>If you broaden, it would necessarily mean that the government would be mandated to create as many offices as are possible to accommodate as many people as are also possible.</i> That is the meaning of broadening opportunities to public service. <i>So, in order that we should not mandate the State to make the government the number one employer and to limit offices only to what may be necessary and expedient yet offering equal opportunities to access to it, I change the word</i> "<i>broaden.</i>"</blockquote>Obviously, the provision is not intended to compel the State to enact positive measures that would accommodate as many people as possible into public office. The approval of the "Davide amendment" indicates the design of the framers to cast the provision as simply enunciatory of a desired policy objective and not reflective of the imposition of a clear State burden.<br><br>Moreover, the provision as written leaves much to be desired if it is to be regarded as the source of positive rights. It is difficult to interpret the clause as operative in the absence of legislation since its effective means and reach are not properly defined. Broadly written, the myriad of claims that can be subsumed under this rubric appear to be entirely open-&shy;ended. Words and phrases such as "equal access," "opportunities," and "public service" are susceptible to countless interpretations owing to their inherent impreciseness. Certainly, it was not the intention of the framers to inflict on the people an operative but amorphous foundation from which innately unenforceable rights may be sourced.<br><br>As earlier noted, the privilege of equal access to opportunities to public office may be subjected to limitations. Some valid limitations specifically on the privilege to seek elective office are found in the provisions of the Omnibus Election Code [(OEC)] on "Nuisance Candidates" and COMELEC Resolution No. 6452 dated December 10, 2003 outlining the instances wherein the COMELEC may <i>motu proprio</i> refuse to give due course to or cancel a <i>Certificate of Candidacy</i>.<br><br>As long as the limitations apply to everybody equally without discrimination, however, the equal access clause is not violated. Equality is not sacrificed as long as the burdens engendered by the limitations are meant to be borne by anyone who is minded to file a certificate of candidacy. In the case at bar, there is no showing that any person is exempt from the limitations or the burdens which they create.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied, and italics in the original)</blockquote>Consistent with the foregoing interpretation as to the asserted right to run for public office, the Court, in <i>Aratea v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> notably equated the privilege with simply having the eligibility for the public office. In said case, Section 74 of the OEC was put into the fore in light of a candidate's alleged false material representation in his Certificate of Candidacy (CoC). Said candidate certified under oath that he was eligible for the office he sought election despite having been elected and having served for four consecutive terms already immediately prior to the term for the relevant election period. The Court ruled accordingly:<br><blockquote>Section 74 requires the candidate to certify that he is eligible for the public office he seeks election. Thus, Section 74 states that "the certificate of candidacy shall state that the person filing x x x is eligible for said office." The three-term limit rule, enacted to prevent the establishment of political dynasties and to enhance the electorate's freedom of choice, is found both in the Constitution and the law. After being elected and serving for three consecutive terms, an elective local official cannot seek immediate reelection for the same office in the next regular election because he is ineligible. One who has an ineligibility to run for elective public office is not "eligible for [the] office." <u>As used in Section 74, the word "eligible" means having the right to run for elective public office, that is, having all the qualifications and none of the ineligibilities to run for the public office.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Citation and emphasis omitted, and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>In the same vein, the question as to whether there is an implicitly recognized fundamental right to run for public office has likewise been settled by the Court in another case, <i>Quinto v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (<i>Quinto</i>). What was assailed in said case was COMELEC Resolution No. 8678 on the Guidelines on the Filing of Certificates of Candidacy and Nomination of Official Candidates of Registered Political Parties in Connection with the May 10, 2010 National and Local Elections. Petitioners therein, who were appointive public officials, questioned Section 4(a) of COMELEC Resolution No. 8678, which provided for the effects of filing of CoCs, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Effects of Filing Certificates of Candidacy</i>. &#8211; a) Any person holding a public appointive office or position including active members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and other officers and employees in government-owned or controlled corporations, shall be considered <i>ipso facto</i> resigned from his office upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy.</blockquote>The Court initially declared Resolution No. 8678 unconstitutional for violating the equal protection clause and for being overbroad. On reconsideration, however, the Court reversed its original decision, taking its cue from the US jurisprudence where the right to run for public office was being anchored on the fundamental freedoms of expression and association. It held that the right to run for public office is not accorded a constitutional guarantee as its purported ties with the other well-settled and recognized fundamental freedoms of expression and association are tenuous. Thus:<br><blockquote>Accordingly, our assailed Decision's submission that the right to run for public office is "inextricably linked" with two fundamental freedoms &#8211; those of expression and association &#8211; lies on barren ground. American case law has in fact <b>never recognized a fundamental right to express one's political views through candidacy, as to invoke a rigorous standard of review</b>. <b><i>Bart v. Telford</i></b> <u>pointedly stated that "[t]he First Amendment does not in terms confer a right to run for public office, and this court has held that it does not do so by implication either." Thus, one's interest in seeking office, <b>by itself</b>, is <b>not</b> entitled to constitutional protection.</u> Moreover, one cannot bring one's action under the rubric of freedom of association, absent any allegation that, by running for an elective position, one is advancing the political ideas of a particular set of voters.<br><br>Prescinding from these premises, it is crystal clear that the provisions challenged in the case at bar, are not violative of the equal protection clause. The deemed-resigned provisions substantially serve governmental interests (<i>i.e.</i>, (i) efficient civil service faithful to the government and the people rather than to party; (ii) avoidance of the appearance of "political justice" as to policy; (iii) avoidance of the danger of a powerful political machine; and (iv) ensuring that employees achieve advancement on their merits and that they be free from both coercion and the prospect of favor from political activity). These are interests that are important enough to outweigh the non-fundamental right of appointive officials and employees to seek elective office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis in the original, and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><i>Quinto</i> took note of the cases decided by the SCOTUS, <i>United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers AFL&shy;-CIO</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (<i>Letter Carriers</i>) and <i>Broadrick v. State of Oklahoma</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (<i>Broadrick</i>), which both impugned the constitutionality of statutory provisions prohibiting federal and state employees, under pain of dismissal and possible criminal sanctions, from taking an active part in political management or in political campaigns. Specifically, these prohibited acts were with regard to announcements of candidacy for nomination or election to local office.<br><br>In <i>Letter Carriers</i>, the plaintiffs challenged the enforcement by the Civil Service Commission of a prohibition under the so-called Hatch Act against active participation in political management or political campaigns which said plaintiffs desired to engage in. In particular, these desired activities included campaigning for candidates for public office, <b>running for state and local offices</b>, and participating as a delegate in a party convention or holding office in a political club. In upholding the constitutionality of the ban, the SCOTUS significantly explained:<br><blockquote>We unhesitatingly reaffirm the x x x holding that Congress had, and has, the power to prevent x x x others x x x from holding a party office, working at the polls, and acting as party paymaster for other party workers. An Act of Congress going no farther would, in our view, unquestionably be valid. So would it be if, in plain and understandable language, the statute forbade activities such as organizing a political party or club; actively participating in fund-raising activities for a partisan candidate or political party; <b>becoming a partisan candidate for, or campaigning for, an elective public office</b>; actively managing the campaign of a partisan candidate for public office; initiating or circulating a partisan nominating petition or soliciting votes for a partisan candidate for public office; or serving as a delegate, alternate or proxy to a political party convention. <b>Our judgment is that neither the First Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution invalidates a law barring this kind of partisan political conduct by federal employees.</b><br><br>Such decision on our part would no more than confirm the judgment of history, a judgment made by this country over the last century that <b>it is in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that federal service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service, and that the political influence of federal employees on others and on the electoral process should be limited</b>. That this judgment eventuated is indisputable, and the major steps in reaching it may be simply and briefly set down.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In <i>Broadrick</i>, on the other hand, state employees charged by the Oklahoma State Personnel Board with actively engaging in partisan political activities among their coworkers for the benefit of their superior, in alleged violation of &sect; 818 of the Oklahoma's Merit System of Personnel Administration Act, challenged the Act's validity on the grounds that two of its paragraphs were overbroad and vague. One of these paragraphs especially provided that no such employee shall belong to 'any national, state or local committee of a political party' or be an officer or member of a committee or a partisan political club, <b>or a candidate for any paid public office</b>, or take part in the management or affairs of any political party or campaign 'except to exercise his right as a citizen privately to express his opinion and vote.' The SCOTUS likewise upheld the constitutionality of the assailed Section in the Act, discerning that it restricted the political activities of the State's classified civil servants in much the same manner that the Hatch Act, the challenged Act in <i>Letter Carriers</i>, proscribed partisan political activities of federal employees. The SCOTUS thus held:<br><blockquote>Unlike ordinary breach-of-the-peace statutes or other broad regulatory acts, &sect; 818 is directed, by its terms, at political expression which if engaged in by private persons would plainly be protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. But at the same time, &sect; 818 is not a censorial statute, directed at particular groups or viewpoints. <b>The statute, rather, seeks to regulate political activity in an even-handed and neutral manner. As indicted, such statutes have in the past been subject to a less exacting overbreadth scrutiny. Moreover, the fact remains that &sect; 818 regulates a substantial spectrum of conduct that is as manifestly subject to state regulation as the public peace or criminal trespass. This much was established in <i>United Public Workers v. Mitchell</i>, and has been unhesitatingly reaffirmed today in <i>Letter Carriers</i> x x x. Under the decision in <i>Letter Carriers</i>, there is no question that &sect; 818 is valid at least insofar as it forbids classified employees from:</b> soliciting contributions for partisan candidates, political parties, or other partisan political purposes; becoming members of national, state, or local committees of political parties, or officers or committee members in partisan political clubs, <b>or candidates for any paid public office</b>; taking part in the management or affairs of any political party's partisan political campaign; serving as delegates or alternates to caucuses or conventions of political parties; addressing or taking an active part in partisan political rallies or meetings; soliciting votes or assisting voters at the polls or helping in a partisan effort to get voters to the polls; participating in the distribution of partisan campaign literature; initiating or circulating partisan nominating petitions; or riding in caravans for any political party or partisan political candidate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Hence, the Court in <i>Quinto</i> observed that the SCOTUS in <i>Letter Carriers</i> and <i>Broadrick</i> declared the assailed provisions in said cases compliant with the equal protection clause:<br><blockquote>x x x [The SCOTUS] held that (i) in regulating the speech of its employees, the state as employer has interests that differ significantly from those it possesses in regulating the speech of the citizenry in general; (ii) the courts must therefore balance the legitimate interest of employee free expression against the interests of the employer in promoting efficiency of public services; (iii) if the employees' expression interferes with the maintenance of efficient and regularly functioning services, the limitation on speech is not unconstitutional; and (iv) the Legislature is to be given some flexibility or latitude in ascertaining which positions are to be covered by any statutory restrictions. Therefore, insofar as government employees are concerned, the correct standard of review is an interest&shy;-balancing approach, a means-end scrutiny that examines the closeness of fit between the governmental interests and the prohibitions in question.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>The Court further observed that following <i>Letter Carriers</i> and <i>Broadrick</i>, the US First Circuit Court of Appeals in the subsequent case of <i>Magill v. Lynch</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> concluded thusly:<br><blockquote>[T]hat <u>the view that political candidacy was a fundamental interest which could be infringed upon only if less restrictive alternatives were not available, was a position which was no longer viable</u>, since the Supreme Court (finding that the government's interest in regulating both the conduct and speech of its employees differed significantly from its interest in regulating those of the citizenry in general) had given little weight to the argument that prohibitions against the coercion of government employees were a less drastic means to the same end, deferring to the judgment of Congress, and applying a "balancing" test to determine whether limits on political activity by public employees substantially served government interests which were "important" enough to outweigh the employees' First Amendment rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Citation and emphasis omitted, and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>To be sure, an argument may be made that <i>Quinto</i> and the US cases it relied upon were all premised on the legitimate and compelling interest of the State to direct the conduct of its employees in the name of efficient public service. Herein petitioners, who are non-incumbent public servants, evidently do not fall within the State's control or supervision. Notably, however, <i>Quinto</i> itself appeared to have acknowledged the general application of the principle laid down in <i>Letter Carriers</i> and <i>Broadrick</i> when it concluded that "American case law has in fact never recognized a fundamental right to express one's political views through candidacy, as to invoke a rigorous standard of review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> One of the relevant US cases <i>Quinto</i> cited, at this turn, was <i>Clements v. Fashing</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (<i>Clements</i>), where the SCOTUS concluded that candidacy is not a "fundamental right" that itself requires departure from traditional equal protection principles under which state-law classifications need only be drawn in such a manner as to bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state end. In so holding, <i>Clements</i> cited <i>Bullock v. Carter</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> where the only issue at hand was the exorbitant primary election fees. <i>Clements</i>' incisive discussion thus went on:<br><blockquote><b>Far from recognizing candidacy as a "fundamental right," we have held that the existence of barriers to a candidate's access to the ballot "does not, of itself, compel close scrutiny."</b> "In approaching candidate restrictions, it is essential to examine in a realistic light the extent and nature of their impact on voters." In assessing challenges to state election laws that restrict access to the ballot, this Court has not formulated a "litmus-paper test for separating those restrictions that are valid from those that are invidious under the Equal Protection Clause." Decision in this area of constitutional adjudication is a matter of degree, and involves a consideration of the facts and circumstances behind the law, the interests the State seeks to protect by placing restrictions on candidacy, and the nature of the interests of those who may be burdened by the restrictions.<br><br>Our ballot access cases, however, do focus on the degree to which the challenged restrictions operate as a mechanism to exclude certain classes of candidates from the electoral process. The inquiry is whether the challenged restriction unfairly or unnecessarily burdens the "availability of political opportunity." This Court has departed from traditional equal protection analysis in recent years in two essentially separate, although similar, lines of ballot access cases.<br><br>One line of ballot access cases involves classifications based on wealth. In invalidating candidate filing-fee provisions, for example, we have departed from traditional equal protection analysis because such a "system falls with unequal weight on voters, as well as candidates, according to their economic status." "Whatever may be the political mood at any given time, our tradition has been one of hospitality toward all candidates without regard to their economic status." Economic status is not a measure of a prospective candidate's qualifications to hold elective office, and a filing fee alone is an inadequate test of whether a candidacy is serious or spurious. Clearly, the challenged provisions in the instant case involve neither filing fees nor restrictions that invidiously burden those of lower economic status. This line of cases, therefore, does not support a departure from the traditional equal protection principles.<br><br>The second line of ballot access cases involves classification schemes that impose burdens on new or small political parties or independent candidates. These cases involve requirements that an independent candidate or minor party demonstrate a certain level of support among the electorate before the minor party or candidate may obtain a place on the ballot. In these cases, the Court has emphasized that the States have important interests in protecting the integrity of their political processes from frivolous or fraudulent candidacies, in ensuring that their election processes are efficient, in avoiding voter confusion caused by an overcrowded ballot, and in avoiding the expense and burden of run-off elections. To this end, the Court has upheld reasonable level-of-&shy;support requirements and classifications that turn on the political party's success in prior elections. The Court has recognized, however, that such requirements may burden First Amendment interests in ensuring freedom of association, as these requirements classify on the basis of a candidate's association with particular political parties. Consequently, the State may not act to maintain the "<i>status quo</i>" by making it virtually impossible for any but the two major parties to achieve ballot positions for their candidates.<br><br>The provisions of the Texas Constitution challenged in this case do not contain any classification that imposes special burdens on minority political parties or independent candidates. The burdens placed on those candidates subject to &sect; 19 and &sect; 65 in no way depend upon political affiliation or political viewpoint.<br><br>It does not automatically follow, of course, that we must apply traditional equal protection principles in examining &sect; 19 and &sect; 65 merely because these restrictions on candidacy do not fall into the two patterns just described. But this fact does counsel against discarding traditional principles without first examining the nature of the interests that are affected and the extent of the burden these provisions place on candidacy. <b>Not all ballot access restrictions require "heightened" equal protection scrutiny.</b> The Court, for example, applied traditional equal protection principles to uphold a classification scheme that denied absentee ballots to inmates in jail awaiting trial. <b>Thus, it is necessary to examine the provisions in question in terms of the extent of the burdens that they place on the candidacy of current holders of public office.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, and citations omitted)</blockquote>Verily, the foregoing shows that the right to run or be voted for public office is neither an explicit nor implicit fundamental right or liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. As such, using the rational basis test against the assailed provisions in this case, what the Court should only be mindful of, are whether (1) the provisions carry a legitimate government interest and (2) whether there is a reasonable connection between such governmental interest and the means employed to achieve it, <i>i.e.</i>, making distinctions between different sets of candidates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><em><strong>There is no rational basis for the prohibition under the assailed provisions nor is it reasonably connected to the policy behind the party-list system.</strong></em></div></td><td width="70%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Although the assailed provisions demand the application only of the rational basis test in determining their reasonableness, being that the right to run for public office is not constitutionally-guaranteed, I concur that the law and rules challenged do not pass this test.<br><br>A careful understanding of the case shows that petitioners' equal protection challenge is double-layered: <i>First</i>, petitioners assail the distinction made between party-list representatives and district representatives in that the prohibition under the assailed provisions only apply to the former and not to the latter. <i>Second</i>, they challenge the distinction made within the class of party-list nominees, specifically between nominees who lost in the previous elections and those who won or did not participate therein.<br><br>The first challenge &#8211; that the assailed provisions only apply to party-&shy;list representatives and not to district representatives &#8211; is already answered sufficiently by Section 5(1). They cannot apply to district representatives precisely because the Constitution, <i>via</i> Section 5(1), allows legislation of additional qualifications only as to party-list representatives. Pursuant to <i>SJS</i>, the Congress cannot add to the qualifications for national elective positions enumerated in the Constitution, including those for district representatives.<br><br>However, as to the second layer &#8212; distinguishing between party-list nominees who failed to win in the prior election and those who won or did not participate therein &#8212; there appears to be no rational basis and no connection between singling out such political losers and the policy behind the party-list system. Indeed, a closer look at the Congressional deliberations and a deeper appreciation of the policy behind the party-list system of representation as envisioned by the framers of the 1987 Constitution shows that the prohibition under Section 8 of RA 7941, and consequently its implementing rules under COMELEC Resolution No. 10717, lacks any rational basis and is inconsistent with the legitimate government interest behind the party-list system.<br><br>Section 2 of RA 7941 embodies the policy behind the party list system of representation, thus:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered national, regional and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, <b>which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to the marginalized and under&shy;represented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well&shy;-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives</b>. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the <b>broadest possible representation</b> of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by <b>enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature</b>, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Hence, the intent behind the law is evident, <i>i.e.</i>, to enhance the chances of Filipinos belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations, and parties and those who lack well-defined political constituencies to compete for and win seats in the legislature.<br><br>In <i>Atong Paglaum, Inc. v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (<i>Atong Paglaum</i>), the Court pronounced that the party-list system under the 1987 Constitution is intended to democratize political power by giving political parties that cannot win in legislative district elections a chance to win seats in the HOR. In line with this intent, the Court adopted a broad construction of the law, ruling that the system embraces both sectoral and non-sectoral parties, that "marginalized and underrepresented" includes those who are such along economic as well as ideological lines, and that even major political parties may participate through their sectoral wings. In the end, <i>Atong Paglaum</i>, consistent with the policy of attaining the widest representation for the marginalized and underrepresented who cannot compete in the district elections, substantially expanded the guidelines laid down in <i>Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and <i>Barangay Association for National Advancement and Transparency (BANAT) v. COMELEC</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The Court ruled:<br><blockquote>The 1987 Constitution provides the basis for the party-list system of representation. Simply put, the party-list system is intended to democratize political power by giving political parties that cannot win in legislative district elections a chance to win seats in the [HOR]. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Indisputably, the framers of the 1987 Constitution intended the party-list system to include not only sectoral parties but also non-sectoral parties. The framers intended the sectoral parties to constitute a part, but not the entirety, of the party-list system. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The common denominator between sectoral and non-sectoral parties is that they cannot expect to win in legislative district elections but they can garner, in nationwide elections, at least the same number of votes that winning candidates can garner in legislative district elections. The party-&shy;list system will be the entry point to membership in the [HOR] for both these non-traditional parties that could not compete in legislative district elections.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>This interpretation will harmonize the 1987 Constitution and [RA] 7941 and will give rise to a multi-party system where those "marginalized and underrepresented," <b><i>both in economic and ideological status</i></b>, will have the opportunity to send their own members to the [HOR]. This interpretation will also make the party-list system honest and transparent, eliminating the need for relatively well-off party-list representatives to masquerade as "wallowing in poverty, destitution and infirmity," even as they attend sessions in Congress riding in SUVs.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The 1987 Constitution and R.A. No. 7941 allow major political parties to participate in party-list elections so as to encourage them to work assiduously in extending their constituencies to the "marginalized and underrepresented" and to those who "lack well-defined political constituencies." The participation of major political parties in party-list elections must be geared towards the entry, as members of the [HOR], of the "marginalized and underrepresented" and those who "lack well-&shy;defined political constituencies," giving them a voice in law-making. Thus, to participate in party-list elections, a major political party that fields candidates in the legislative district elections must organize a sectoral wing, like a labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, professional, women or youth wing, that can register under the party-list system.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We cannot, however, fault the COMELEC for following prevailing jurisprudence in disqualifying petitioners. In following prevailing jurisprudence, the COMELEC could not have committed grave abuse of discretion. However, for the coming 13 May 2013 party-list elections, we must now impose and mandate the party-list system <b>actually envisioned and authorized</b> under the 1987 Constitution and [RA] 7941. In <i>BANAT</i>, this Court devised a new formula in the allocation of party-list seats, reversing the COMELEC's allocation which followed the then prevailing formula in <i>Ang Bagong Bayani</i>. In <i>BANAT</i>, however, the Court did not declare that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion. Similarly, even as we acknowledge here that the COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion, we declare that it would not be in accord with the 1987 Constitution and [RA] 7941 to apply the criteria in <i>Ang Bagong Bayani</i> and <i>BANAT</i> in determining who are qualified to participate <b>in the coming 13 May 2013 party-list elections</b>. For this purpose, we suspend our rule that a party may appeal to this Court from decisions or orders of the COMELEC only if the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Citations omitted, and emphasis and italics in the original)</blockquote>Section 2 of RA No. 7941 and <i>Atong Paglaum</i> are clear as to the policy behind the party-list representation &#8211; according as much political opportunity to the ideologically and economically marginalized or underrepresented because they could not otherwise reasonably compete in the district elections. In this regard, excluding defeated candidates in the previous elections from the party-list system does not further this policy. On the contrary, historically, failure in the elections has been attributed to economic disadvantages and lack of strong political bases. It appears that these are precisely the influences that the party-list system seeks to diminish, so that those who are traditionally disadvantaged in politics for being marginalized and underrepresented can have a real chance at becoming a legislator.<br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that a prohibition on candidates from becoming a party-list nominee in the <i>same</i> elections is more in keeping with the purported basis of Section 8 of RA 7941 of preventing the abuse of the party-list system by treating the same as a fallback for losing candidates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Apart from the intent of both houses of Congress in passing the law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> this is consistent with Section 73 of the OEC which prohibits the filing of CoCs for more than one position in the same elections, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Sec. 73. Certificate of candidacy.</b> &#8211; No person shall be eligible for any elective public office unless he files a sworn certificate of candidacy within the period fixed herein.<br><br>A person who has filed a certificate of candidacy may, prior to the election, withdraw the same by submitting to the office concerned a written declaration under oath.<br><br><b>No person shall be eligible for more than one office to be filled in the same election, and if he files his certificate of candidacy for more than one office, he shall not be eligible for any of them.</b> However, before the expiration of the period for the filing of certificates of candidacy, the person who was filed more than one certificate of candidacy may declare under oath the office for which he desires to be eligible and cancel the certificate of candidacy for the other office or offices.<br><br>The filing or withdrawal of a certificate of candidacy shall not affect whatever civil, criminal or administrative liabilities which a candidate may have incurred. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Notably, Section 73 refers to a candidate who "files his certificate of candidacy for more than one office" who then "shall not be eligible for any of them." Given the language of Section 73, one can argue that it does not apply to a candidate who is likewise a party-list nominee. To recall, a party-&shy;list nominee does not file a CoC. Instead, under COMELEC Resolution No. 10717, the nominating sectoral party, organization or coalition is required to file a Certificate of Nomination which lists, among others, the names of its nominees, while the nominee is required to file a corresponding Certificate of Acceptance of Nomination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the OEC was enacted on December 3, 1985 whereas the party-list system was introduced under the 1987 Constitution. In other words, the Congress, in passing the OEC, had not contemplated the party-&shy;list system of representation.<br><br>Hence, there presently appears to be no express legal prohibition against candidates for an elective position from becoming, in the same elections, a nominee for a party, organization or coalition. This supports the theory that the intention of the legislature was, in fact, to pass a law embodying such prohibition instead of Section 8 as presently worded. The evil of using the party-list system as a "backdoor" for the rich and powerful is certainly greater in the case of a candidate who is simultaneously a party-list nominee than one who lost a bid in the prior elections and is trying his or her luck again, this time as a party-list nominee.<br><br>The party&shy;-list system is a significant innovation of the present Constitution in the composition of the members of the HOR. The system is intended to democratize political power by giving political parties that cannot win in legislative district elections a chance to win seats in the HOR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Significantly, the participation of any national, regional, and sectoral parties in party-list elections must be geared towards the entry, as member of the HOR, of the "marginalized and underrepresented" and those who "lack well-defined political constituencies," giving them a voice in law-making.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Equally important, a party&shy;-list nominee must be a <i>bona fide</i> member of the party or organization which he or she seeks to represent. In the case of sectoral parties, to be a <i>bona fide</i> party-list nominee one must either belong to the sector represented, or have a track record of advocacy for such sector.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Hence, given the nature and noble objectives of the party-list system, it is, indeed, imperative that the misuse of the system be seriously guarded against. Indeed, the party-&shy;list system has been criticized as having evolved into a backdoor for the rich and powerful to further entrench themselves in Congress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Local officials affected by term limits are, in particular, criticized for using the party-list system to wield power and influence as they prepare to regain their position in the next election cycle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>However, I fail to appreciate how the assailed provisions guard against these possible abuses. For instance, local officials who become party-list nominees in the meantime that the three-term limit prohibits them from running for their customary local positions are necessarily victors in the previous elections. Hence, they will not be prevented by the prohibition on political losers under the assailed provisions from exploiting the party-&shy;list system. The distinction created palpably fails to advance any legitimate governmental interest.<br><br>In sum, I agree that Congress is empowered by Section 5(1) to provide for disqualifications of party-list nominees. However, such legislation is subject to basic constitutional limitations, including the equal protection clause. In determining the reasonableness of a classification made by a law enacted pursuant to Section 5(1) such as the assailed provisions, the rational basis test applies because the right to seek public office is not a fundamental right. Applying this test in the present case, the assailed provisions fail to demonstrate any rational basis to support it. In fact, its discrimination against losing candidates of the immediately preceding election clearly offends the policy behind the party-list system of attaining the broadest possible representation for the marginalized, underrepresented and those without well-defined political constituencies. As such, the assailed provisions are unconstitutional for violating the equal protection clause under the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I vote to grant the Consolidated Petitions and to declare the assailed provisions unconstitutional.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Sec. 8. <i>Nomination of Party-List Representatives</i>.

Nomination of Party-List Representatives. &#8212; Each registered party, organization or coalition shall submit to the COMELEC not later than forty-five (45) days before the election a list of names, not less than five (5) from which party-list representatives shall be chosen in case it obtains the required number of votes.<br><br>A person may be nominated in one (1) list only. Only persons who have given their consent in writing may be named in the list. <b>The list shall not include any candidate for any elective office or a person who has lost his bid for an elective office in the immediately preceding election.</b> xxx</blockquote><b>One.</b> Generally, controversies involving equal protection right center on <b>two primary questions</b>.<br><br>The <b>first</b> is <i>how far, or in relation to what rights, does the command of equality intend to apply?</i> We ask, <i>equal as to what</i>, or <i>what rights are we all supposed to be equal at? Does it entail any or all of civil, political, social, or economic equality?</i> For instance, if my neighbor earns more than I do because the government prescribed wage rate allows this individual to earn more than I would ever in my lifetime, would the equal protection right compel economic equality between us?<br><br>The <b>second</b> is <i>what does it mean to treat persons equally?</i> In other words, <i>what is equal treatment?</i> In the same illustration, supposing I am entitled to be economically equal with my neighbor, that is, we ought to have economic equality, how would this equal treatment be achieved? Must the neighbor's pay be reduced, or should mine be increased, or do I get other perks to compensate for the inequality?<br><br>In our legal system, the <b>main test</b> for deciding these and other equal protection challenges is:<br><blockquote>The equal protection clause means that <b>no person</b> or <b>class of persons</b> shall be deprived of the <b>same protection</b> of laws <b>enjoyed by other persons</b> or other classes in the <b>same place</b> in <b>like circumstances</b>. Thus, the guarantee of the equal protection of laws is <b>not violated</b> if there is <b>reasonable classification</b>. It must be shown, therefore, that the <b>classification</b> (1) rests on <b>substantial distinctions</b>; (2) is <b>germane to the purpose</b> of the law; (3) is <b>not limited to existing conditions</b> only; and (4) <b>applies equally to all members</b> of the same class.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>Under this test, the scope of equal protection is as broad as any governmental action. The command to treat persons equally extends to <b>all actions</b> by the government. Thus, as expressed in the test, our concept of the equal protection right is that it is <b>not <i>per se</i></b> an <b>anti-discrimination</b> rule <i>though</i> it <b>encompasses anti-discrimination</b> as well. Thus, in <i>Sameer Overseas Placement Agency Inc. v. Cabiles</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the Court said:<br><blockquote>Equal protection of the law is a guarantee that persons under like circumstances and falling within the same class are treated alike, in terms of "privileges conferred and liabilities enforced." It is a guarantee against "undue favor and individual or class privilege, <b>as well as hostile discrimination or the oppression of inequality</b>."</blockquote>By <b>discrimination</b>, I mean <b>treating someone differently</b> based on <b>specific characteristics</b> protected by law, where this <b>treatment has a negative effect</b> on that person. This has been generally referred to as <b>suspect classifications</b>.<br><br>Examples of these <b>characteristics</b> include <i>ancestry</i> (including color and perceived race); <i>nationality</i> or <i>national origin</i>; <i>religion</i> or <i>creed</i>; <i>ethnic background</i> or <i>origin</i>; <i>age</i>; <i>sex</i> (including sex-determined characteristics such as pregnancy); <i>gender identity</i>; <i>sexual orientation</i>; <i>marital</i> or <i>family status</i>; <i>source</i> and <i>level of income</i>; <i>political belief</i>, <i>physical</i> or <i>mental disability</i>; <i>social</i> or <i>historical disadvantage</i>; and <i>other characteristics subjected to prejudice</i> or <i>group stereotypes</i>, such as criminal record.<br><br><b>Prejudicial treatment</b>, when based on those <b>specific characteristics</b>, is considered <b>discrimination</b>, as is <b>failing to reasonably accommodate</b> the special needs of a person or group. Often, individuals or classes having these specific characteristics are <b>accorded special protection by our <i>Constitution</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Discrimination is prohibited by law because it <b>offends the dignity</b> of a person.<br><br>Under our <b>main test</b>, as indicated by its use of the phrase <b>reasonable classification</b>, the standard analysis of equal protection challenges has followed the <b>rational basis test</b>. This is coupled with a <b>deferential attitude</b> to legislative classifications and a <b>reluctance to invalidate</b> a law. The <b>exception</b> is where there is a <b>showing of a clear and unequivocal breach of the <i>Constitution</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>But <i>Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan v.

The Court referred to it as a <b>strict scrutiny</b> of the classifications to determine if they do or do not rest on any real or substantial distinctions that would justify different treatments. This standard and its overarching analytical framework were developed in American jurisprudence in accordance with its historical and state interests in mind.<br><br>The above strict scrutiny standard and its overarching analysis were <b>not</b> followed in some of the subsequent cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Sameer Overseas Placement Agency Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> appears to have abandoned this line of analysis in <i>Serrano</i> when the former, despite citing the latter, held:<br><blockquote>We <b>do not need strict scrutiny to conclude</b> that these classifications do not rest on any real or substantial distinctions that would justify different treatments in terms of the computation of money claims resulting from illegal termination.</blockquote><i>Disini v. Secretary of Justice</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> did not also see the need to apply strict scrutiny since no suspect classifications were involved, and more tellingly, <b>universally condemnable act or conduct</b> was targeted and therefore should be immediately classified and quarantined for being such.<br><br>I perceive some well-meaning reluctance to accept the strict scrutiny standard and its overarching analysis because of its alien overtures that may not befit our own values and circumstances. Further, it appears to be intuitive to accept the <b>rational basis test</b> as our <b>sole main test</b> for equal protection. The reason is that its premise of <b>invalidating classifications</b> that <b>clearly</b> and <b>unequivocally breach</b> the <i>Constitution</i> is a <b>simple reiteration</b> of the fundamental and straightforward legal doctrine that the <i>Constitution</i> is the supreme law and anything that violates it is void. This choice of the rational basis test <b>does away</b> with the confusing <i>nuanced</i> and <i>tiered tests</i> in American jurisprudence on equal protection.<br><br>Under the <b>rational basis test</b>, we determine whether the <b>classification</b> is <b>reasonable</b>. To do this, we must establish:</madison></madison><madison><madison><blockquote><ul><li>Is there a <b>legitimate government interest</b> behind the classification?<br></li><li>Is the <b>classification rationally related to this legitimate government interest</b>?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></li></ul></blockquote>If the answer is yes to both questions, we must then <b>inform</b> the reasons for the affirmative answers with responses to: (i) whether there are <b>substantial</b> distinctions between or among the classes; (ii) whether the classification is <b>germane</b> to the purpose of the law, <b>not limited</b> to existing conditions, and <b>applies equally</b> to all members of the same class; and (iii) whether the classification <b>clearly</b> and <b>unequivocally breaches</b> the <i>Constitution</i>. These <b>questions</b> constitute the <b>rational basis test</b>. The <b>affirmative answers to these questions</b> in turn constitute the hallmarks of a <b>reasonable classification</b>.<br><br>In this test, there is generally little second-guessing as to <i>whether the law works</i>. The <i>analysis of alternatives</i> is irrelevant. The <b>starting point</b> is that the law that imposes the classification is <b>presumptively constitutional</b>. The burden is on the complaining party to show that the <b>only purpose</b> of the legislation was <i>entirely arbitrary, irrational</i>, or <i>invidiously discriminatory</i>.<br><br>Here, the underlying classification in the assailed portion of Section 8, Republic Act No. 7941 has <b>nothing to do</b> with discriminatory or suspect classifications. <b>No</b> persons especially accorded protection by the <i>Constitution</i> are involved. The classification <b>does not distinguish</b> between <b>historically</b> or <b>socially disadvantaged</b> individuals or groups or others whose <b>immutable characteristics</b> are subjected to prejudice or group stereotypes, on one hand, <i>and</i> <b>normal</b> persons, on the other. Hence, the <b>appropriate standard of review</b> for Section 8 is the <b>rational basis test</b>.<br><br><b>Two.</b> It is obvious from the test of equal protection that <b>comparison</b> plays a role throughout the equal protection guarantee. <b>Equality</b> is a <b>comparative</b> concept, the condition of which may only be attained or discerned <b>by comparison</b> with the condition of others. This basic right requires an <b>inherently comparative analysis</b>. Thus, the <b>threshold</b> is to <b>determine</b> that one group is <b>unequally treated</b> as against another. When we say unequal treatment, however, we mean <b>substantive equality</b> as opposed to <b>formal equality</b>. There is no greater inequality than the equal treatment of unequals. Ironically, it is unfair and bad law to treat everyone equally because not everyone is equal.<br><br>Critical in every equal protection analysis is the <b>identification</b> of the <b>proper comparator groups</b>. A court must <b>identify differential treatment</b> as compared to one or more other persons or groups. These are the ones against whom the <b>classified group</b> in the assailed law is <b>measured</b> against. Locating the <b>appropriate comparator</b> is <b>necessary</b> in identifying <b>differential</b> treatment. To <b>establish</b> that indeed a <b>classification</b> has been made by the assailed law, we ask:</madison></madison><madison><madison><blockquote><ul><li>Does the challenged provision, <i>on its face</i> or <i>in its impact</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, since the equal protection right may be infringed not only by the legislation itself, but by the actions of a delegated decision-maker applying it), <b>create a distinction</b>? and,<br></li><li>If so, does the distinction <b>impose burdens</b> or <b>deny a benefit</b>?</li></ul></blockquote>This threshold <b>distinction</b> or <b>classification stage</b> of the analysis should immediately bar claims that are not intended to be prohibited by the equal protection right because <b>no classifications</b> have actually been made.<br><br>Caution must be taken in this stage of analysis &#8211; this means that the analysis must examine every <b>contextual impact of intersecting grounds of differential treatment</b>. In this stage, we must <b>account for adverse consequences</b> of the assailed law. This is done to determine whether indeed the assailed law establishes a <b>classification</b> and whether this <b>classification</b> truly imposes a burden or denies a benefit.<br><br>From the <b>threshold test</b> of distinctions and classifications and moving forward to the <b>main test</b> of equal protection, to arrive at whether the impugned law infringes the equal protection guarantee, it must be <b>viewed as a whole</b>. What is required is an <b>approach</b> that takes account of the <b>full context</b> of the <b>claimant group's situation</b>. That context will include the <b>legislative, political</b> and <b>social contexts</b> as well as the <b>actual impact</b> of the law on that situation.<br><br><i>More</i>, we must also examine the <b>object of the assailed law</b> in the context of its broader legislative scheme, taking into account the <b>universe of potential beneficiaries</b> <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the <b>universe of potentially encumbered or disadvantaged targets</b>. A law <b>must necessarily draw distinctions</b> to achieve <b>certain policy goals</b> while <b>properly allocating resources</b> or <b>opportunities</b>.<br><br>What must be asked is whether the <b>purpose of the assailed law</b> corresponds to the <b>needs of the claimant groups</b> when considered in the context of the whole scheme, or <b>does it force them to carry a burden</b> that others do not? The analysis is contextual, not formalistic, grounded in the actual situation of the group and the potential of the impugned law to worsen their situation.<br><br><b>Three.</b> The assailed provision is a part of Section 8 and specifically states: "Nomination of Party-List Representatives.... The list shall <b>not include any candidate</b> for <b>any elective office</b> or a <b>person</b> who has <b>lost his bid for an elective office</b> in the <b>immediately preceding election</b>...."<br><br>Applying the test of equal protection to this assailed provision, I note the following <b>comparator groups</b>:<br><br>1. <b>Candidates of any elective office</b> running in the current elections <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> <b>nominees</b> of party-list organizations running in the current elections.<br><br>2. <b>Political parties of candidates</b> and <b>candidates themselves of any elective office</b> running in the current elections <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> <b>registered party-list organization</b> or <b>coalition</b> running in the current elections.<br><br>3. <b>Winning candidates</b> of any elective post in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b> <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> <b>losing candidates</b> of any elective post in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b>.<br>&nbsp;<br><u><b><i>Threshold Test</i></b></u><br><br>First, does the challenged provision, <i>on its face</i> or <i>in its impact</i> (i.e., since the equal protection right may be infringed not only by the legislation itself, but by the actions of a delegated decision-maker applying it), <b>create a distinction</b>?<br><br>The answer is yes.<br><br><b>Candidates of any elective office</b> running in the current elections <i>are treated differently from</i> <b>nominees</b> of party-list organizations running in the current elections. <b>Candidates</b> do <b>not lose</b> their <b>status</b> as <b>candidates</b>, or they are <b>not disqualified</b> as candidates in the current elections, <i>though</i> they are <b>included as nominees</b> of a party-list organization or <b>lost in the immediately preceding</b> elections. <b>Nominees lose</b> their <b>status</b> as <b>nominees</b> if they are candidates in the current elections or were candidates who lost in the immediately preceding elections.<br><br><b>Political parties of candidates</b> and <b>candidates themselves of any elective office</b> running in the current elections <i>are treated differently from</i> <b>registered party-list organizations</b> or <b>coalitions</b> running in the current elections. <b>Political parties</b> are <b>not burdened</b> by the rules under the assailed portion of Section 8, while <b>registered party-list organizations</b> or <b>coalitions</b> are. The same <b>differential treatment</b> exists between the <b>candidates</b> themselves of any other elective office and every <b>registered party-list organization</b> or <b>coalition</b>. The assailed portion of Section 8 applies only to the latter.<br><br><b>Winning candidates</b> of any elective post in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b> <i>are treated differently from</i> <b>losing candidates</b> of any elective post in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b>, in that the former <b>qualify</b> as <b>nominees</b> of party-list organizations running in the current elections <b>while</b> the latter <b>do not qualify</b> as such nominees.<br><br>Second, does the distinction <b>impose burdens</b> or <b>deny a benefit</b>?<br><br>The answer is yes. There are <b>burdens</b> imposed upon <b>nominees</b> of party-list organizations running in the current elections, <b>registered party-list organizations</b> or <b>coalitions</b> running in the current elections, and <b>losing candidates</b> of any elective post in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b>.<br><br><u><b><i>Rational Basis Test</i></b></u><br><br>Is there a <b>legitimate government interest</b> behind the classification?<br><br>The answer is yes. As the <i>ponencia</i> admits, the legitimate government interest is <b>to protect the integrity of the party-list system</b> of electing representatives by <b>disallowing</b> or <b>discouraging</b> the <b>traditional</b> elective officials from <b>crowding, monopolizing</b> or <b>abusing</b> the party-list system of representation to perpetuate themselves in power. It may also be said that the legitimate government interest is <b>to prevent traditional politicians</b> from <b>abusing</b> the party-list system as a <b>backdoor</b> to <b>entrench</b> themselves in power, thereby <b>defeating</b> the <b>purpose</b> of the party&shy;-list system as a means to give legislative voice to the marginalized and underrepresented sectors of our country.<br><br>Is the <b>classification rationally related to this legitimate government interest</b>?<br><br>The answer is also yes. By <b>placing</b> an <b>embargo</b> upon the <b>qualifications</b> of <b>nominees</b> of party-list organizations that are <b>not imposed</b> upon <b>political parties</b> of candidates of other elective offices and <b>candidates</b> themselves of other elective offices, and by treating <b>losing candidates</b> in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b> from <b>winning candidates</b> of the same elections, the assailed provision is <b>able to limit, discourage</b> or <b>disallow</b> the <b>abuse</b> of the party-list system as a <b>backdoor</b> for these <b>traditional</b> politicians. The objective is also <b>to promote</b> and <b>strengthen</b> the <b>capacities</b> of <b>organizations</b> who have <b>no machinery</b> to match those candidates in other elective posts, to have voices in and bring their platforms to Congress. The classifications may be <b>under-inclusive</b> but they are <b>nonetheless reasonably related</b> to the government interest articulated above.<br><br>In this regard, there are <b>substantial distinctions</b> between <b>political parties</b> of candidates of any other elective offices and <b>candidates themselves</b> of any other elective offices running in the current elections <i>and</i> <b>registered party-list organization</b> or <b>coalition</b> and <b>nominees</b> of party-&shy;list organizations running in the current elections, and between <b>winning candidates</b> of any elective post in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b> <i>and</i> <b>losing candidates</b> of any elective post in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b>. These <b>substantial distinctions</b> make for a <b>reasonable relation</b> between these <b>classifications</b> and the <b>legitimate government interest</b>.<br><br><b>Candidates</b> are the ones being voted into office. <b>Nominees</b> are not candidates &#8211; they are <b>not voted into office</b>. So are the <b>political parties</b> of candidates in other elective offices. But in a party-list system, the <b>candidates</b> are the <b>party-list organizations</b>. The <b>nominees</b> are intended to be the <b>mere agents</b> of the candidate party-list organization. Even in victory, while <b>candidates</b> hold a piece of the sovereignty by their election to office, neither the <b>political party</b> nor the <b>nominees</b> wield this piece of the sovereignty since for the <b>nominees</b> it is their principal, the <b>registered party-&shy;list organization</b> or <b>coalition</b>, that does carry this piece of the sovereignty.<br><br><b>Losing candidates</b> in the <i>immediately preceding elections</i> are <b>different</b> from <b>winning candidates</b> in the <i>immediately preceding elections</i> in that they have the slightest probability of winning in the <b>traditional</b> elective posts. Hence, the <b>attraction</b> and <b>temptation</b> to test the party-list system would be stronger among these <b>losing candidates</b> than it would be for <b>winning candidates</b>. The idea is <b>to avoid</b> the party-list system from <b>becoming a dumping ground</b> of losers in the traditional elective posts and <b>usurping</b> the party-list system to regain power when this system is supposed to have the marginalized and underrepresented in mind as beneficiaries.<br><br>The classifications are <b>germane</b> to the purpose of the assailed portion of Section 8. They are <b>not alien</b> to it. They are <b>reasonably tailored</b> to achieve the legitimate government interest mentioned above. The classifications too are <b>not limited</b> to existing conditions. They are <b>perpetually imposed</b> so long as Section 8 is in effect. They also <b>apply equally</b> to all members of the same class &#8211; <b>each registered party-list organization</b> or <b>coalition, all party-list nominees</b> and <b>all losing candidates</b> in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b>.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><em><strong><u>Contextual impact of intersecting grounds of differential treatment and adverse consequences</u></strong></em></div></td><td width="70%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br><b>Nominees</b> of party-list organizations running in the current elections and <b>losing candidates</b> for any elective post in the <b>immediately preceding elections</b> have <b>no</b> <i>social</i> or <i>historical disadvantage</i> or <i>other characteristics subjected to prejudice</i> or <i>group stereotypes</i>.

The <b>nominees</b> do <b>not</b> have the <b>right</b> to nominate themselves. The right belongs to the <b>party-list organizations</b>. Section 5 (1) of the <i>Constitution</i> speaks of the "party-list system <b>of registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations</b>." Section 8 of Republic Act No. 7941 identifies the <b>right-holder</b> to <b>nominate</b> as <b>each of the registered party, organization</b> or <b>coalition</b>:<br><blockquote>Nomination of Party-List Representatives. &#8212; <b>Each registered party, organization or coalition shall submit</b> to the COMELEC not later than forty-five (45) days before the election a <b>list of names, not less than five (5) from which party-list representatives</b> shall be chosen <b>in case it obtains the required number of votes</b>. A <b>person may be nominated</b> in one (1) list only. Only <b>persons</b> who have given their consent in writing may be named in the list.</blockquote>The <b>nominees</b> are <b>mere persons</b>. They are the objects of the decision-&shy;making done by each registered party, organization or coalition. They have <b>no rights</b> except the <b>right to consent</b> to the nomination. But the <b>nomination right</b> itself does <b>not</b> belong to the <b>nominee</b>. The nominees hold <b>no right to be nominated</b>.<br><br>Here, the <b>equal protection challenge</b> to the assailed portion of Section 8 <b>properly belongs</b> to <b>registered party-list organizations</b> or <b>coalitions</b> since it is <b><u><i>their</i></u> right to nominate</b> that is alleged to have been infringed by the classification that is <b>not imposed</b> upon the other <b>comparator groups</b>. Petitioners have <b>no standing</b> to bring this suit since <b>they have not been injured</b> by the assailed provision or more precisely the <b>reasonable classification</b> made therein. Hence, I <b>cannot agree</b> to grant relief to petitioners.<br><br><b>Five.</b> We <b>cannot allow</b> the Court to be Congress' carte-blanche supervisor when it comes to what are <b>reasonable classifications</b>. It is in the nature of things that <b>all laws classify</b>, and <b>all laws make distinctions</b>, leading to a <b>virtually unlimited</b> number of potential equal protection challenges. <b>Close judicial review</b> of all classifications to ensure equal protection of the laws is a <b>practical impossibility</b>. Although the clause protects all persons, the Court, as a <b>practical</b> matter, <b>cannot give close scrutiny</b> to all classifications that governmental action may create among persons.<br><br>Thus, so long as the classification has a <b>rational basis</b> in relation to a <b>legitimate government objective</b>, and the complainant is not able to show that the <b>only purpose</b> of the legislation was <i>entirely arbitrary, irrational</i>, or <i>invidiously discriminatory</i>, the Court cannot second-guess Congress as to what the proper allocation of resources, opportunities, burdens and obligations and the proper classification of the universes of beneficiaries and burdened targets, should be.
