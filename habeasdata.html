            <p>The petition may also be filed with the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals or the Sandiganbayan when the action concerns public data files of government offices.</p>
            <p>SEC. 4.&nbsp; <em>Where Returnable; Enforceable.</em>&mdash;When the writ is issued by a Regional Trial Court or any judge thereof, it shall be returnable before such court or judge.</p>
            <p>When issued by the Court of Appeals or the Sandiganbayan or any of its justices, it may be returnable before such court or any justice thereof, or to any Regional Trial Court of the place where the petitioner or respondent resides, or that which has jurisdiction over the place where the data or information is gathered, collected or stored.</p>
            <p>When issued by the Supreme Court or any of its justices, it may be returnable before such Court or any justice thereof, or before the Court of Appeals or the Sandiganbayan or any of its justices, or to any Regional Trial Court of the place where the petitioner or respondent resides, or that which has jurisdiction over the place where the data or information is gathered, collected or stored.</p>
            <p>The writ of <em>habeas data </em>shall be enforceable anywhere in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>SEC. 5.&nbsp; <em>Docket Fees.</em>&mdash;No docket and other lawful fees shall be required from an indigent petitioner.&nbsp; The petition of the indigent shall be docketed and acted upon immediately, without prejudice to subsequent submission of proof of indigency not later than fifteen (15) days from the filing of the petition.</p>
            <p>SEC. 6.&nbsp; <em>Petition.</em>&mdash;A verified written petition for a writ of <em>habeas data </em>should contain:</p>

            <p>SEC. 18.&nbsp; <em>Hearing on Officer&rsquo;s Return.</em>&mdash;The court shall set the return for hearing with due notice to the parties and act accordingly.</p>
            <p>SEC. 19.&nbsp; <em>Appeal.</em>&mdash;Any party may appeal from the judgment or final order to the Supreme Court under Rule 45.&nbsp; The appeal may raise questions of fact or law or both.</p>

            <p>SEC. 24.&nbsp; <em>Suppletory Application of the Rules of Court.</em>&mdash;The Rules of Court shall apply suppletorily insofar as it is not inconsistent with this Rule.</p>
