                        2019  SUPREME COURT REVISED RULE ON CHILDREN IN CONFLICT WITH THE
                        LAW
                    </strong>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Section 1</strong>. <em>Applicability  of the Rule</em>. — This
                    Rule shall apply to all criminal cases involving  children in conflict
                    with the law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A child in  conflict with the law is a person below 18 years old who is
                    alleged as, accused  of, or adjudged as having committed an offense
                    under Philippine Laws. (a)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Rule shall  not apply to a person who at the time of the initial
                    contact as defined in  Section 4(s) of this Rule shall have reached the
                    age of eighteen (18) in which  case, the regular rules on criminal
                    procedure shall apply without prejudice to  the rights granted under
                    Sections 51, 52, 53 and 54 of this Rule.  Nor shall this Rule apply to
                    "children at  risk" as defined in Section 4(g) of this Rule. (a)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Section 2</strong>. <em>Objective</em>.  — The objective of this
                    Rule is to ensure that the justice system treats every  child in
                    conflict with the law in a manner that recognizes and upholds human
                    dignity and worth, and instills in the child respect for the fundamental
                    rights  and freedom of others. The Rule considers the developmental age
                    of the child  and the desirability of the child's reintegration in and
                    assumption of a  constructive role in society in accordance with the
                    principles of restorative  justice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To attain this objective,  the Rule seeks:
                </p>

                    programs and services for  crime prevention, diversion, rehabilitation,
                    re-integration and aftercare to  ensure the normal growth and
                    development of the child in conflict with the law;
                </p>
                <p>
                    (b)               To  provide procedural rules dealing with children in
                    conflict with the law that  take into account their distinct
                    circumstances, assure all parties of a fair  hearing with each party's
                    constitutional and statutory rights recognized and  respected, and
                    ensure that appropriate disposition measures are implemented by  law
                    enforcers, social services and the courts;

                    conflict with the law who can  be cared for or placed under

                    (d)               To  deal with the child in a family environment

                <p>
                    (e)               To  remove from children in conflict with the law, the

                <p>
                    (g)               To  provide for the care, protection and wholesome
                    moral, mental, and physical  development of children in conflict with
                    the law; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    (h)               To  promote and protect the rights and interest of
                    children as zones of peace in  situations of armed conflict, but who are
                    alleged to be in conflict with the  law. (a)
                </p>

                </p>

                    (a)                 Issue  a closure order terminating the case if it is
                    convinced that the child has  complied satisfactorily with the diversion
                    program; or
                </p>
                <p>

                    or that the program is  not serving its purpose. In case of a
                    judicially-approved transfer of residence  of the child in conflict with
                    the law, the court to which supervision of the  diversion program was

                    waive presence at the trial pursuant to  the stipulations set forth in
                    the bail bond, unless presence at the trial is  specifically ordered by

                    shall be considered a waiver of the right of the child to be present.

            </p>
            <p>
                (l) The judgment  shall be in proportion to the gravity of the offense, and
                shall consider the  circumstances and the best interest of the child, the
                rights of the victim, and  the needs of society in line with the demands of

                (2)                Restrictions  on the personal liberty of the child shall
                be limited to the minimum. Where  discretion is given by law to the judge to
                determine whether the penalty to be  imposed is fine or imprisonment, the
                imposition of fine should be preferred as  the more appropriate penalty.

            <p>
                (3)                No  corporal punishment shall be imposed.

                (4)                In  case of the presence of any exculpatory evidence or
                doubt in the prosecution's  evidence, the doubt shall be resolved in favor
                of the child.

                the trial, the court should find the child in  conflict with the law guilty
                beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged, it  shall impose the proper
                penalty, including any civil liability which the child  may have incurred,
                and promulgate the sentence in accordance with Section 6,  Rule 120 of the

                of executing the judgment of  conviction, shall place the child in conflict
                with the law under suspended  sentence, without need of application.
                Suspension of sentence can be availed of even if the child is already
                eighteen  years (18) of age or more but not above twenty-one (21) years old,
                at the time  of the pronouncement of guilt, without prejudice to the child's
                availing of  other benefits such as probation, if qualified, or adjustment
                of penalty, in  the interest of justice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefits of  suspended sentence shall not apply to a child in conflict
                with the law who has  once enjoyed suspension of sentence, but shall
                nonetheless apply to one who is  convicted of an offense punishable by
                <em>
                    reclusion perpetua

                reclusion perpetua,  and after application of the privileged mitigating
                circumstance of minority. If  the child in conflict with the law reaches
                eighteen (18) years of age while  under suspended sentence, the court shall
                determine, upon the recommendation of  the social worker assigned to the
                child and after considering the various  circumstances, whether to discharge
                the child in accordance with the provisions  of Republic Act No. 9344, as
                amended, or to extend the suspended sentence for a  maximum period of up to
                the time the child reaches twenty-one (21) years of  age, or to order
