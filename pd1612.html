                <p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> such robbery and thievery have become profitable on the part of the lawless

                    sell, or in any other manner deal in any article, item, object or anything of value which he knows,
                    or should be known to him, to have been derived from the proceeds of the crime of robbery or

                    <p> b. "Fence" includes any person, firm, association corporation or partnership or other
