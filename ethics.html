                written consent of his  client filed in court. He may also retire at any
                time from an action or special  proceeding, without the consent of his
                client, should the court, on notice to  the client and attorney, and on
                hearing, determine that he ought to be allowed  to retire. In case of
                substitution, the name of the attorney newly employed  shall be entered on
                the docket of the court in place of the former one, and  written notice of
                the change shall be given to the advance party.

            <p>
                A  client may at any time dismiss his attorney or substitute another in his
                place,  but if the contract between client and attorney has been reduced to
                writing and  the dismissal of the attorney was without justifiable cause, he
                shall be  entitled to recover from the client the full compensation
                stipulated in the  contract. However, the attorney may, in the discretion of
                the court, intervene  in the case to protect his rights. For the payment of
                his compensation the  attorney shall have a lien upon all judgments for the
                payment of money, and  executions issued in pursuance of such judgment,
                rendered in the case wherein  his services had been retained by the client.

                counsel,  pecuniary interest, personal bias, or his having acted as counsel
                to his acting  as such Investigator. Where the Investigator does not
                disqualify himself, a  party may appeal to the IBP Board of Governors, which
                by majority vote of the members  present, there being a quorum, may order

                Willful  failure or refusal to obey a subpoena or any other lawful order

                court. The  corresponding charge shall be filed by the Investigator before
                the IBP Board of  Governors which shall require the alleged contemnor to

                thereafter conduct  hearings, if necessary, in accordance with the procedure

                shall as far as practicable  be terminated within fifteen (15) days from its
                commencement. Thereafter, the  IBP Board of Governors shall within a like
                period of fifteen (15) days issue a  resolution setting forth its findings
                and recommendations, which shall forthwith  be transmitted to the Supreme

                the whole  record, finds that such defect has resulted or may result in a
                miscarriage of  justice, in which event the Board shall take such remedial

                shall be in writing  and shall clearly and distinctly state the facts and
                the reasons on which it is  based. It shall be promulgated within a period
                not exceeding thirty (30) days  from the next meeting of the Board following
                the submittal of the  Investigator's Report.
            </p>

                b) If  the Board, by the vote of a majority of its total membership,

                c) If  the respondent is exonerated by the Board or the disciplinary
                sanction imposed  by it is less than suspension or disbarment (such as
                admonition, reprimand, or  fine) it shall issue a decision exonerating

                with the Supreme Court within  fifteen (15) days from notice of the Board's
                resolution, the Supreme Court  orders otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                d)  Notice of the resolution or decision of the Board shall be given to all
                parties  through their counsel. A copy of the same shall be transmitted to
                the Supreme  Court.

                If a witness  fails to appear at the time and place specified in the
                subpoena issued by any  inferior court, the cost of the warrant of arrest
                and of the arrest of the  witness shall be paid by the witness if the court
                shall determine that his  failure to answer the subpoena was wilful or
                without just excuse.
            </p>

                discretion tax costs for the person so cited and issue execution therefor,
                allowing the same fees as for witnesses in Courts of First Instance.
