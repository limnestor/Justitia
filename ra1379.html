        <div align="justify"><i>Be it enacted, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress
            assembled:<br><br></i>SECTION 1. <i>Definitions.</i>&#8212;<br>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>For the purposes of this Act, a "public officer or employee" means any person holding any public
                    office or employment by virtue of an appointment, election or tract, and any person holding any
                    office or employment, by appointment or contract, in any State owned or controlled corporation or
                    enterprise.<br></li>
                <li>"Other legitimately acquired property" means an real or personal property, money or securities which
                    the respondent has at any time acquired by inheritance and the income thereof, or by gift <i>inter
                        vivos</i> before his becoming a public officer or employee, or any property (or income thereof)
                    already pertaining to him when he qualified for public office or employment, or the fruits and
                    income of the exclusive property of the respondent's spouse. It shall not include:<br>
                    <ol><br>
                        <li>Property unlawfully acquired by the respondent, but its ownership is concealed by its being
                            recorded in the name of, or held by, the respondent's spouse, ascendants, descendants,
                            relatives, or any other person.<br></li>
                        <li>Property unlawfully acquired by the respondent, but transferred by him to another person or
                            persons on or after the effectivity of this Act.<br></li>
                        <li>Property donated to the respondent during his incumbency, unless he can prove to the
                            satisfaction of the court that the donation is lawful.<br></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            SEC. 2. <i>Filing of petition.</i>&#8212;Whenever any public officer or employee has acquired during his
            incumbency an amount of property which is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer
            or employee and to his other lawful income and the income from legitimately acquired property, said property
            shall be presumed <i>prima facie</i> to have been unlawfully acquired. The Solicitor General, upon complaint
            by any taxpayer to the city or provincial fiscal who shall conduct a previous inquiry similar to preliminary
            investigations in criminal cases and shall certify to the Solicitor General that there is reasonable ground
            to believe that there has been committed a violation of this Act and the respondent is probably guilty
            thereof, shall file, in the name and on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, in the Court of First
            Instance of the city or province where said public officer or employee resides or holds office, a petition
            for a writ commanding said officer or employee to show cause why the property aforesaid, or any part
            thereof, should not be declared property of the State: <i>Provided,</i> That no such petition shall be filed
            within one year before any general election or within three months before any special election.<br><br>The
            resignation, dismissal or separation of the officer or employee from his office or employment in the
            Government or in the Government-owned or controlled corporation shall not be a bar to the filing of the
            petition: <i>Provided, however,</i> That the right to file such petition shall prescribe after four years
            from the date of the resignation, dismissal or separation or expiration of the term of the officer or
            employee concerned, except as to those who have ceased to hold office within ten years prior to the approval
            of this Act, in which case the proceedings shall prescribe after four years from the approval
            hereof.<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>The petition.</i>&#8212;The petition shall contain the following information:<br>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The name and address of the respondent.<br></li>
                <li>The public office or employment he holds and such other public offices or employment which he has
                    previously held.<br></li>
                <li>The approximate amount of property he has acquired during his incumbency in his past and present
                    offices and employments.<br></li>
                <li>A description of said property, or such thereof as has been identified by the Solicitor General.<br>
                </li>
                <li>The total amount of his government salary and other proper earnings and incomes from legitimately
                    acquired property, and<br></li>
                <li>Such other information as may enable the court to determine whether or not the respondent has
                    unlawfully acquired property during his incumbency.<br></li>
            </ol>
            SEC. 4. <i>Period for the answer.</i>&#8212;The respondent shall have a period of fifteen days within which
            to present his answer. <br><br>SEC. 5. <i>Hearing.</i>&#8212;The court shall set a date for a hearing, which
            may be open to the public, and during which the respondent shall be given ample opportunity to plain, to the
            satisfaction of the court, how he has quired the property in question.<br><br>SEC. 6. <i>Judgment.</i>&#8212;If
            the respondent is unable to show to the satisfaction of the court that he has lawfully acquired the property
            in question, then the court shall declare such property, forfeited in favor of the State, and by virtue of
            such judgment the property aforesaid shall become property of the State: <i>Provided, </i>That no judgment
            shall be rendered within six months before any general election or within three months before any special
            election. The Court may, in addition, refer this case to the corresponding Executive Department for
            administrative or criminal action, or both.<br><br>SEC. 7. <i>Appeal.</i>&#8212;The parties may appeal from
            the judgment of the Court of First Instance as provided in the Rules of Court for appeals in civil
            cases.<br><br>SEC. 8. <i>Protection against self-incrimination.</i>&#8212;Neither the respondent nor any
            other person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, papers, correspondence,
            memoranda and other records on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required
            of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to prosecution; but no individual shall be prosecuted
            criminally for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he is compelled, after
            having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, documentary or
            other wise, except that such individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and conviction
            for perjury or false testimony committed in so testifying or from administrative proceedings.<br><br>SEC. 9.
            <i>Immunity.</i>&#8212;The Solicitor General may grant immunity from criminal prosecution to any person who
            testifies to the unlawful manner in which the respondent has acquired any of the property in question in
            cases where such testimony is necessary to prove violations of this Act.<br><br>SEC. 10. <i>Effect of record
                of title.</i>&#8212;The fact that any real property has been recorded in the Registry of Property or
            office of the Register of Deeds in the name of the respondent or of any person mentioned in paragraphs (1)
            and (2) of subsection (b) of section one hereof shall not prevent the rendering of the judgment referred to
            in section six of this Act.<br><br>SEC. 11. <i>Laws on prescription.</i>&#8212;The laws concerning
            acquisitive prescription and limitation of actions cannot be invoked by, nor shall they benefit the
            respondent, in respect of any property unlawfully acquired by him.<br><br>SEC. 12. <i>Penalties.</i>&#8212;Any
            public officer or employee who shall, after the effective date of this Act, transfer or convey any
            unlawfully acquired property shall be repressed with imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or a
            fine not exceeding ten thousand pesos, or both such imprisonment and fine. The same repression shall be
            imposed upon any person who shall knowingly accept such transfer or conveyance.<br><br>SEC. 13. <i>Separability
                of provisions.</i>&#8212;If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or
            circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the Act and the application of such provision to other
            persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.<br><br>SEC. 14. <i>Effective date.</i>&#8212;This
            Act shall take effect on its approval, and shall apply not only to property thereafter unlawfully acquired
            but also to property unlawfully acquired before the effective date of this Act.<br><br>Approved, June 18,
            1955.<br></div>
