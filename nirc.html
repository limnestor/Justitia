            <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>(D) Change from Accrual to Installment Basis.</strong></em> - If a taxpayer entitled to the benefits of Subsection (A) elects for any taxable year to report his taxable income on the installment basis, then in computing his income for the year of change or any subsequent year, amounts actually received during any such year on account of sales or other dispositions of property made in any prior year shall not be excluded.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">In case the corporation is entitled to a tax credit or refund of the excess income taxes paid during the year, the excess amount shown on its final adjustment return may be carried over and credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. Once the option to carry over and apply the said excess income tax paid against the income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor: Provided, That in case the taxpayer cannot carry over the excess income tax credit due to dissolution or cessation of business, the taxpayer shall file an application for refunds of any unutilized excess income tax credit, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue shall decide on the application and refund the excess taxes within two (2) years from the date of the dissolution or cessation of business.</p>

The Strategic Investment Priority Plan shall be valid for a period of three (3) years, subject to review and amendment every three (3) years thereafter unless there would be a supervening event that would necessitate its review.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Strategic Investment Priority Plan shall contain the following:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(A) Priority projects or activities that are included in the Philippine Development Plan or its equivalent, or other government programs, taking into account any of the following:</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">(9) Contribution to Philippine food security and increase incomes in the agriculture and fisheries sector; or</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">All sectors or industries that may be included in the Strategic Investment Priority Plan shall undergo an evaluation process to determine the suitability and potential of the industry or the sector in promoting long-term growth and sustainable development, and the national interest. In no case shall a sector or industry be included in the Strategic Investment Priority Plan unless it is supported by a formal evaluation process or report.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The projects or activities must comply with the specific qualification requirements or conditions for a particular sector or industry and other limitations as set and determined by the Board of Investments, and in coordination with the Fiscal Incentives Review Board.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In no case shall the Investment Promotion Agencies accept applications unless the project or activity is listed in the Strategic Investment Priority Plan. Projects or activities not listed in the Strategic Investment Priority Plan shall be automatically disapproved.”</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SEC. 301. <em>Power of the President to Grant Incentives</em>.</strong> - Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 295 and 296, the President may, in the interest of national economic development and upon the recommendation of the Fiscal Incentives Review Board, modify the mix, period or manner of availment of incentives provided under this Code or craft the appropriate financial support package for a highly desirable project or a specific industrial activity based on defined development strategies for creating high-value jobs, building new industries to diversify economic activities, and attracting significant foreign and domestic capital or investment, and the fiscal requirements of the activity or project, subject to maximum incentive levels recommended by the Fiscal Incentives Review Board: <em>Provided</em>, That the grant of income tax holiday shall not exceed eight (8) years and thereafter, a special corporate income tax rate of five percent (5%) may be granted: <em>Provided, further</em>, That the total period of incentive availment shall not exceed forty (40) years.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Fiscal Incentives Review Board shall determine whether the benefits that the Government may derive from such investment are clear and convincing and far outweigh the cost of incentives that will be granted in determining whether a project or activity is highly desirable.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The exercise by the President of his powers under this Section shall be based on a positive recommendation from the Fiscal Incentives Review Board upon its determination that the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">(1) The project has a comprehensive sustainable development plan with clear inclusive business approaches, and high level of sophistication and innovation; and</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;">(2) Minimum investment capital of Fifty billion pesos (P50,000,000,000.00) or its equivalent in US dollars, or a minimum direct local employment generation of at least ten thousand (10,000) within three (3) years from the issuance of the certificate of entitlement.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Provided, That the threshold shall be subject to a periodic review by the Fiscal Incentives Review Board every three (3) years, taking into consideration international standards or other economic indicators: Provided, further, That if the project fails to substantially meet the projected impact on the economy and agreed performance targets, the Fiscal Incentives Review Board shall recommend to the President the cancellation of the tax incentive or financial support package or the modified period or manner of availment of incentives, after due hearing and an adequate opportunity to substantially comply with the agreed performance targets and outputs.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">For this purpose, financial support includes utilization of government resources such as land use, water appropriation, power provision, and budgetary support provision under the annual General Appropriations Act.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This power of the President, in as far as it commands additional public sector expenditures in support of investors, is suspended during fiscal years when, an unimaginable fiscal deficit is declared by the President on the advice of the Development Budget Coordination Committee with a consequence that even core budgetary obligations, such as, but not limited to, mandatory revenue allotments for local government units and budget for the National Economic and Development Authority's core public investments program, cannot be fully financed.<sup>[<a href="#fn253">253</a>]</sup></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the provisions in the preceding paragraphs, tax and duty incentives granted through legislative franchises shall be excepted from the foregoing powers of the President to review, withdraw, suspend, or cancel tax incentives and subsidies.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SEC. 302. <em>Amendments to the Strategic Investment Priority Plan</em>.</strong> - Subject to publication requirements and the criteria for investment priority determination, the Board of Investments may include additional areas in the Strategic Investment Priority Plan, alter any of the terms of the declaration of an investment area, and temporarily suspend projects or activities on the Strategic Investment Priority Plan if it considers that such project or activity is no longer a priority within the effectivity of the Strategic Investment Priority Plan.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><sup><a name="fn19"></a>[19]</sup> This paragraph was originally part of the amendments introduced by the TRAIN Law on Section 6(F), but was vetoed by the President. The veto message reads: “I am constrained to veto the provision under Section 6(F) of the enrolled bill that effectively maintains the special tax rate of 15% of gross income for the aforementioned employees, to wit: ‘Provided, however, That existing RHQs/ROHQs, OBUs or petroleum service contractors and subcontractors presently availing of preferential tax rates for qualified employees shall continue to be entitled to avail of the preferential tax rate for present and future qualified employees. While I understand the laudable objective of the proposal, the provision is violative of the Equal Protection Clause under Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution, as well as the rule of equity and uniformity in the application of the burden of taxation: Section 1. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws. In line with this, the overriding consideration is the promotion of fairness of the tax system for individuals performing similar work. Given the significant reduction in the personal income tax, the employees of these forms should follow the regular tax rates applicable to other individual taxpayers.” Under Sec. 4 (C) of Revenue Regulation (RR) 08-18, the effect of the VETO is that the 15% preferential income tax rate under subsections (C) (D) and (E) of Sec. 25 of the Tax Code, as amended, shall no longer be applicable which means that the concerned employees of the regional or area headquarters and regional operating headquarters of multinational companies, offshore banking units and petroleum service contractors and subcontractors shall be subject to the regular income tax, without prejudice, however, to the application of preferential tax rates under tax treaties, if applicable. Reading the provisions of the TRAIN Law and RR 8-2018, all employees (whether Filipino or alien) of RHQs, ROHQs, OBUs and petroleum contractors and subcontractors shall be subject to the graduated income tax rates under Sec. 24 (A)(2)(a) of the Tax Code.</p>

            <p><sup><a name="fn93"></a>[93]</sup> The amendment introduced by the TRAIN Law was vetoed by the President. The veto message reads:</p>
            <p>I am constrained to veto the provisions under Section 33 of the enrolled bill, to wit:</p>
            <p>Section 33:</p>
            <p>(8) Services Rendered To:</p>
            <p>I. Registered Enterprises Within A Separate Customs Territory As Provided Under Special Laws; and</p>
            <p>II. Registered Enterprises Within Tourism Enterprise Zones As Declared By the TIEZA Subject To the Provisions Under Republic Act No. 9593 Or The Tourism Act of 2009.</p>
            <p>The above provisions go against the principle of limiting the VAT zero-rating to direct exporters. The proliferation of separate customs territories, which include buildings, creates significant leakages in our tax system. This makes the tax system highly inequitable and significantly reduces the revenues that could be better used for the poor. As to tourism enterprises, the current law only allows for duty and tax free importation of capital equipment, transportation equipment and other goods. The TIEZA Law explicitly allows only duty and tax free importation of capital equipment, transportation equipment and other goods (in certain cases and always subject to rules provided by the DOF). Thus, this provision actually grants a new incentive to suppliers of registered tourism enterprises. At any rate, TIEZA law, which is still in effect for two more years, can be used to avail of the above-mentioned incentives.</p>

            <p><sup><a name="fn99"></a>[99]</sup> The amendment introduced by RA11534 or the CREATE Law was vetoed by the President. Hence, the original provision remains. The President, in his veto message, states that –</p>
            <p>I am constrained to veto item (P) of the amended Section 109 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended (Tax Code), under Section 12 of this Act, to wit:</p>
            <p>"(P) Sale of real properties not primarily held for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or business or real property utilized for low-cost and socialized housing as defined by Republic Act No. 7279, otherwise known as the 'Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992', and other related laws, residential lot valued at Two million five hundred thousand Pesos (P2,500,OOO.OO) and below, house and lot, and other residential dwellings valued at Four million two hundred thousand Pesos (P4,200,OOO.OO) and below: Provided, That beginning January 1, 2024 and every three (3) years thereafter, the amounts herein stated shall be adjusted to present values using the Consumer Price Index, as published by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)";</p>
            <p>Under the Tax Code, as amended by the TRAIN Law, the sales of house and lot and other residential dwellings valued at not more than P2.5 million shall be VATexempt. The exemption is targeted to provide relief to buyers of socialized housing and base-level economic housing. The amendment in the CREATE Act increases the VAT-threshold to up to P4.2 million. In effect, this will benefit even those not originally targeted for the VAT-exemption—those who can actually afford proper housing. This results in a tax exemption that is highly distortive and exacts a heavy price on the taxpaying community. The provision is also prone to abuse, as properties can be parceled into lots so that their individual values fall within the VAT-exempt threshold.</p>
            <p>If not vetoed, the estimated revenue loss from the foregoing is PI 55.3 billion from 2020 to 2030, which could be used in public goods to benefit the poor directly.</p>

            <p><sup><a name="fn201"></a>[201]</sup> The amendment introduced by the CREATE Law was vetoed by the President. The veto message on the proposed 90-day period for the processing of general tax refunds reads:</p>
            <p>For being administratively impracticable, I am constrained to veto the whole of Section 14 of this Act, to wit:</p>
            <p>SEC. 14. Section 204 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:</p>
            <p>SEC. 204. Authority of the Commissioner to Compromise, Abate, and Refund or Credit Taxes. —The Commissioner may — <br /> "(A) x xx<br /> "(B) x xx<br /> "(C) Credit or refund taxes erroneously or illegally received or penalties imposed without authority, refund the value of internal revenue stamps when they are returned in good condition by the purchaser, and in his discretion, redeem or change unused stamps that have been rendered unfit for use and refund their value upon proof of destruction. No credit or refund of taxes or penalties shall be allowed unless the taxpayer files in writing with the Commissioner a claim or refund within two (2) years after the payment of the tax or penalty: Provided, however, That a return filed showing an overpayment shall be considered as a written claim for credit or refund: Provided, further, That in proper cases, the Commissioner shall grant a refund for taxes or penalties within ninety (90) days from the date of complete submission of the documents in support of the application filed: Provided, furthermore, That should the Commissioner find that the grant of refund is not proper, the Commissioner must state in writing the legal and factual basis for the denial: Provided, finally, That in case of full or partial denial of the claim for tax refund, the taxpayer affected may, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of the decision denying the claim, appeal the decision with the Court of Tax Appeals."</p>
            <p>While I laud the intention to improve tax administration, this provision is administratively difficult for the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to implement and may cause delayed or erroneous processing of refund claims. The general form of tax refund under Section 204 of the Tax Code, as distinguished from VAT refunds in Section 112 of the same Code, requires a full audit of all internal revenue tax liabilities and examination of the tax payments, books, and returns filed by a taxpayer. Aside from this, the Tax Code itself requires the Commission on Audit to examine refunds. Thus, it is incumbent upon the BIR to exercise utmost diligence in granting a general tax refund. This is not possible within a 90-day period for all cases. I do not want the BIR to be forced to choose between only two (2) awful choices: grant tax refunds haphazardly, or deny an application outright considering the short period given to the BIR to process the same and then have the taxpayer go to court with his refund being unnecessarily delayed. Thus, while imposing a hard deadline may appear good on paper, the actual experience in the conduct of a full audit in general tax refund will either cause damage to the government if the BIR acts haphazardly, or cause more delays to the prejudice of the taxpayers if the BIR chooses the more convenient option of simply denying applications given the time constraints. As alternative, I suggest that the legislature, the Department of Finance, and the BIR, come up with mechanisms to streamline the process of tax refunds in a separate tax administration bill.</p>

            <p><sup><a name="fn235"></a>[235]</sup> Vetoed under Par C. The President, in his veto message under Par. C - Definition of investment capital, states that –</p>
            <p>I am constrained to veto item (g) of the new Section 293 of the Tax Code under Section 16 of this Act:</p>
            <p>"(g) Investment capital refers to the value of investment indicated in Philippine currency, excluding the value of land and working capital, that shall be used to carry out a registered project or activity, except that land shall be included as investment capital for registered real estate development. Investment capital may include the cost of land improvements, buildings, leasehold improvements, machinery and equipment, and other non-current tangible assets;"</p>
            <p>The term "investment capital" is relevant in determining which registered projects or activities shall fall within the approving jurisdiction of the Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB). To ensure that currently operational administrative processes are not unduly disturbed, I prefer that we adopt the measures now used by investment promotion agencies to determine the scale of an investment. Excluding land and operating expenses from the measure of an investment's total scale may also lead to an underestimation of our investment promotion performance.</p>
            <p><sup><a name="fn236"></a>[236]</sup> Vetoed under Par. D (1). The President, in his veto message under Par D - Redundant incentives for domestic enterprises, states that –</p>
            <p>The special corporate income tax (SCIT) rate for domestic market enterprises, which is in lieu of all local and national taxes, is redundant, unnecessary, and weakens the fiscal incentives system. Domestic-oriented enterprises are market-seeking enterprises or enterprises that invest in selling goods and services to a market where viable demand exists—with or without tax incentives.</p>
            <p>Tax incentives for domestic market enterprises are only justified to the extent that they yield measurable net benefits to the economy. I find that the generous, targeted, and performance-based enhanced deductions to domestic activities in priority sectors or industries under the CREATE Act are already sufficient incentives for the purpose.</p>
            <p>Contrary to a common misconception that denying domestic enterprises the SCIT is tantamount to abandoning our own local businesses to fend for themselves, vetoing the subject provision is actually for the benefit of all local businesses. It must be emphasized that only registered business entities are proposed to be entitled to SCIT. Thus, local and homegrown firms that are not registered firms, which make up most of our MSMEs, will have to pay more taxes than registered firms. The latter would then have more legroom to reduce prices, secure more contracts, and ultimately take over the market and put our MSMEs out of business. In actuality, this line item veto will effectively level the domestic playing field and provide only the most generous incentives during the most critical times [e.g., income tax holiday 0TH) during start-up years]. After ITH expires, performance-based incentives, specifically the enhanced deductions, will become available. All of these ensure that extended tax savings are matched with targeted spending (e.g., direct labor and research and development) and not awarded outright which is the case if SCIT is extended to them.</p>

            <p>Allowing an additional fourteen (14) to seventeen (17) years of incentives and another ten (10) year-extension for the same activity on top of the original period of incentives enjoyment is fiscally irresponsible and utterly unfair to the ordinary taxpayer and to un incentivized enterprises. Registered business enterprises interested in further enjoying incentives must engage in new activities or projects incentivized in the Strategic Investment Priority Plan. My principle on this matter is simple: only new activities and projects deserve new incentives.</p>

            <p>On the one hand, there are industries in the enumeration that either do not merit support through incentives or are expected to become obsolete in the short-term. On the other hand, there might be economic activities in the mid- to long-term that need to be prioritized and granted tax incentives which are not captured in the current enumeration. The CREATE Act must be kept flexible to be able to keep up with the changing times. Activities and projects should not be hard coded in the law so that we do not keep on incentivizing obsolete industries and close our doors to technological advances and industries of the future.</p>

            <p><sup><a name="fn250"></a>[250]</sup> Vetoed under Par. D (10). The President has vetoed all mention of “/SCIT” in the table after the phrase “For domestic market activities”.</p>
            <p><sup><a name="fn251"></a>[251]</sup> Vetoed under Par. I. The President, in his veto message under Par I – Automatic approval of applications for incentive, states that –</p>
            <p>The automatic approval of applications runs counter to the declared policy to approve or disapprove applications based on merit. The core of the reform is to develop a performance-based tax incentives system. The FIRB or the investment promotion agencies, as the case may be, should be allowed to carefully review the application for tax incentives since these are privileges granted by the State. This important function should not be sacrificed for the sake of expediency.</p>
            <p>Moreover, concerns over inaction can be addressed by the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018, which punishes the failure to render government services within a prescribed time.</p>
            <p><sup><a name="fn252"></a>[252]</sup> Vetoed under Par. F. The President, in his veto message under Par F – Limitations on the power of the FIRB, states that –</p>
            <p>The primary role of the FIRB in the fiscal incentives system of the Philippines is to exercise policy-making and oversight functions on all registered business enterprises and investment promotion agencies. Section 297 (B) is clear that the power of the investment promotion agencies to grant incentives only stems from a delegated authority from the FIRB.</p>
            <p>Corollary to this, the current practice of granting incentives without a regular impact analysis conducted and without regard to the final cost to the government is unacceptable, given our economic aims under the CREATE Act. Consistent with the theme of the "Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act (TIMTA)" emphasizing fiscal accountability and transparency in the grant and management of tax incentives, the oversight functions of the FIRB will ensure the proper grant and monitoring of tax incentives, as well as assure Filipinos that in every peso invested, we get our tax's worth. These powers must remain plenary over those of the investment promotion agencies.</p>
            <p>The concern that the FIRB oversight will result in inordinate delays is highly speculative. Even with the veto of the foregoing provision, the investment promotion agencies retain the delegated power to grant incentives up to a certain threshold amount. The FIRB does not create another layer in the approval process but is simply granted the authority to check whether the incentives granted by the investment promotion agencies conform to the overarching aim of the reform to modernize our incentive system into one that is performance-based, targeted, time-bound, and transparent. The oversight power of the FIRB supports its policy-making function since analyzing important data on all granted incentives is crucial in crafting sound, sustainable, and fiscally responsible incentives policy.</p>
            <p><sup><a name="fn253"></a>[253]</sup> Vetoed under Par. H. The President, in his veto message under Par H – Provision granting the President the power to exempt any investment promotion agency from the reform , states that –</p>
            <p>The provisions allowing any future President the power to exempt an investment promotion agency from the coverage of the CREATE Act disregards the huge steps we have taken to rationalize our fiscal incentives system. It could become a highly political tool that could allow subsequent Presidents to dismantle decades of studies, disregard discussions based on empirical evidence, and even subvert the will of Congress itself. Fair and sensible public policy must bear the quality of uniform application. Exempting any investment promotion agency from the CREATE Act, which provides for transparency, accountability, and proper administration of tax incentives may be used as an escape from the accountability measures institutionalized in that law, and opens a wide path for discretion and capture by vested interests.</p>
