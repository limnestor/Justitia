            <p align="center">
                <strong>New  Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEREAS,  at the Round Table Meeting of Chief Justices held at the Peace
                Palace. The  Hague, on 25â€“26 November 2002, at which the Philippine Supreme
                Court was  represented by the Chief Justice and Associate Justice Reynato S.
                Puno, the  Bangalore Draft of the Code of Judicial Conduct adopted by the
                Judicial Group  on Strengthening Judicial Integrity was deliberated upon and
                approved after  incorporating therein several amendments;
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEREAS,  the Bangalore Draft, as amended, is intended to be the Universal
                Declaration of  Judicial Standards applicable in all judiciaries;
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEREAS,  the Bangalore Draft is founded upon a universal recognition that a
                competent,  independent and impartial judiciary is essential if the courts
                are to fulfill  their role in upholding constitutionalism and the rule of
                law; that public  confidence in the judicial system and in the moral
                authority and integrity of  the judiciary is of utmost importance in a modem
                democratic society; and, that  it is essential that judges, individually and
                collectively, respect and honor  judicial office as a public trust and
                strive to enhance and maintain confidence  in the judicial system;
            </p>
            <p>
                WHEREAS,  the adoption of the universal declaration of standards for ethical
                conduct of  judges embodied in the Bangalore Draft as revised at the Round
                Table Conference  of Chief Justices at The Hague is imperative not only to
                update and correlate  the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Canons of
                Judicial Ethics adopted for the  Philippines, but also to stress the
                Philippines' solidarity with the universal  clamor for a universal code of
                judicial ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOW,  THEREFORE, the Court hereby adopts this New Code of Judicial Conduct
                for the  Philippine Judiciary.

                <strong>Independence</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Judicial  independence is a pre-requisite to the rule of law and a
                fundamental guarantee  of a fair trial. A judge shall therefore uphold and
                exemplify judicial  independence in both its individual and institutional
                aspects.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section  1.</strong> Judges shall exercise the judicial function
                independently on the basis of their assessment of the facts and in
                accordance  with a conscientious understanding of the law, free of any
                extraneous  influence, inducement, pressure, threat or interference, direct
                or indirect,  from any quarter or for any reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section  2.</strong> In performing judicial duties, Judges shall  be
                independent from judicial colleagues in respect of decisions which the judge
                is obliged to make independently.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section  3.</strong> Judges shall refrain from influencing in any
                manner the outcome of litigation or dispute pending before another court or
                administrative agency.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section  4.</strong> Judges shall not allow family, social, or
                other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment. The prestige
                of  judicial office shall not be used or lent to advance the private
                interests of  others, nor convey or permit others to convey the impression
                that they are in a  special position to influence the judge.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section  5.</strong> Judges shall not only be free from
                inappropriate connections with, and influence by, the executive and
                legislative  branches of government, but must also appear to be free
                therefrom to a  reasonable observer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section  6.</strong> Judges shall be independent in relation to
                society in general and in relation to the particular parties to a dispute
                which  he or she has to adjudicate.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section  7.</strong> Judges shall encourage and uphold safeguards
                for the discharge of judicial duties in order to maintain and enhance the
                institutional and operational independence of the judiciary.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Section  8.</strong> Judges shall exhibit and promote high
                standards of judicial conduct in order to reinforce public confidence in the
                judiciary which is fundamental to the maintenance of judicial independence.

                reasonable observer.

            <p>
                <strong>Section  2.</strong> The behavior and conduct of judges must

                <strong>Section  3.</strong> Judges should take or initiate  appropriate
                disciplinary measures against lawyers or court personnel for  unprofessional

                <strong>Section  3.</strong> Judges shall, so far as is reasonable, so

                lawyers  independently of the judge's participation, all agree in writing
                that the  reason for the inhibition is immaterial or unsubstantial, the

                parties and  lawyers, shall be incorporated in the record of the
