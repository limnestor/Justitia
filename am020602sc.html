<p></p>

            <p>Section 1.  <i>Applicability of the Rule.</i> &#8211; This Rule covers the domestic adoption of Filipino children.

            <p>Sec. 2.  <i>Objectives.</i> &#8211; (a) The best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration in all matters relating to his care, custody and adoption, in accordance with Philippine laws, the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child, UN Declaration on Social and Legal Principles Relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption, Nationally and Internationally, and the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.

            <p>(b) The State shall provide alternative protection and assistance through foster care or adoption for every child who is a foundling, neglected, orphaned, or abandoned.  To this end, the State shall:

            <ol type="i">
                <li>ensure that every child remains under the care and custody of his parents and is provided with love, care, understanding and security for the full and harmonious development of his personality. Only when such efforts prove insufficient and no appropriate placement or adoption within the child&#8217;s extended family is available shall adoption by an unrelated person be considered.</li>
                <li>safeguard the biological parents from making hasty decisions in relinquishing their parental authority over their child;</li>

                <li>prevent the child from unnecessary separation from his biological parents;</li>

                <li>conduct public information and educational campaigns to promote a positive environment for adoption;</li>

                <li>ensure that government and private sector agencies have the capacity to handle adoption inquiries, process domestic adoption applications and offer adoption-related services including, but not limited to, parent preparation and post-adoption education and counseling;</li>

                <li>encourage domestic adoption so as to preserve the child&#8217;s identity and culture in his native land, and only when this is not available shall inter-country adoption be considered as a last resort; and</li>

            <li>protect adoptive parents from attempts to disturb their parental authority and custody over their adopted child.</li>
        </ol>

            Any voluntary or involuntary termination of parental authority shall be administratively or judicially declared so as to establish the status of the child as &#8220;legally available for adoption&#8221; and his custody transferred to the Department of Social Welfare and Development or to any duly licensed and accredited child-placing or child-caring agency, which entity shall be authorized to take steps for the permanent placement of the child.

<p></p>
            If a change in the name of the adoptee is prayed for in the petition, notice to the Solicitor General shall be mandatory.
            </ol>

            Sec. 13.  <i>Child and Home Study Reports.</i> &#8211; In preparing the child study report on the adoptee, the concerned social worker shall verify with the Civil Registry the real identity and registered name of the adoptee.  If the birth of the adoptee was not registered with the Civil Registry, it shall be the responsibility of the social worker to register the adoptee and secure a certificate of foundling or late registration, as the case may be.
<p></p>
            The social worker shall establish that the child is legally available for adoption and the documents in support thereof are valid and authentic, that the adopter has sincere intentions and that the adoption shall inure to the best interests of the child.
<p></p>
            In case the adopter is an alien, the home study report must show the legal capacity to adopt and that his government allows the adoptee to enter his country as his adopted child in the absence of the certification required under Section 7(b) of Republic Act No. 8552.
<p></p>
            If after the conduct of the case studies, the social worker finds that there are grounds to deny the petition, he shall make the proper recommendation to the court, furnishing a copy thereof to the petitioner.
<p></p>

            Sec. 14.  <i>Hearing.</i> &#8211; Upon satisfactory proof that the order of hearing has been published and jurisdictional requirements have been complied with, the court shall proceed to hear the petition.  The petitioner and the adoptee must personally appear and the former must testify before the presiding judge of the court on the date set for hearing.
<p></p>
            The court shall verify from the social worker and determine whether the biological parent has been properly counseled against making hasty decisions caused by strain or anxiety to give up the child; ensure that all measures to strengthen the family have been exhausted; and ascertain if any prolonged stay of the child in his own home will be inimical to his welfare and interest.
<p></p>

            Sec. 15.  <i>Supervised Trial Custody.</i> &#8211; Before issuance of the decree of adoption, the court shall give the adopter trial custody of the adoptee for a period of at least six (6) months within which the parties are expected to adjust psychologically and emotionally to each other and establish a bonding relationship.  The trial custody shall be monitored by the social worker of the court, the Department, or the social service of the local government unit, or the child-placement or child-caring agency which submitted and prepared the case studies.  During said period, temporary parental authority shall be vested in the adopter.
<p></p>
            The court may, motu proprio or upon motion of any party, reduce the period or exempt the parties if it finds that the same shall be for the best interests of the adoptee, stating the reasons therefor.
<p></p>
            An alien adopter however must complete the 6-month trial custody except the following:

            <ol type="a"><li>a former Filipino citizen who seeks to adopt a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity; or

                <li>one who seeks to adopt the legitimate child of his Filipino spouse; or

                <li>one who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his or her spouse the latter&#8217;s relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity.</ol>
<p></p>
            If the child is below seven (7) years of age and is placed with the prospective adopter through a pre-adoption placement authority issued by the Department, the court shall order that the prospective adopter shall enjoy all the benefits to which the biological parent is entitled from the date the adoptee is placed with him.
<p></p>
            The social worker shall submit to the court a report on the result of the trial custody within two weeks after its termination.
<p></p>

            Sec. 16.  <i>Decree of Adoption.</i> &#8211; If the supervised trial custody is satisfactory to the parties and the court is convinced from the trial custody report and the evidence adduced that the adoption shall redound to the best interests of the adoptee, a decree of adoption shall be issued which shall take effect as of the date the original petition was filed even if the petitioners die before its issuance.
<p></p>
            The decree shall:

                <ol type="A"><li>State the name by which the child is to be known and registered;

            <li>Order:

                    <ol type="1"><li>the Clerk of Court to issue to the adopter a certificate of finality upon expiration of the 15-day reglementary period within which to appeal;

                <li>the adopter to submit a certified true copy of the decree of adoption and the certificate of finality to the Civil Registrar where the child was originally registered within thirty (30) days from receipt of the certificate of finality.  In case of change of name, the decree shall be submitted to the Civil Registrar where the court issuing the same is situated.

                <li>the Civil Registrar of the place where the adoptee was registered:</li>

                        <ol type="a"><li>to annotate on the adoptee&#8217;s original certificate of birth the decree of adoption within thirty (30) days from receipt of the certificate of finality;

                <li>to issue a certificate of birth which shall not bear any notation that it is a new or amended certificate and which shall show, among others, the following:  registry number, date of registration, name of child, sex, date of birth, place of birth, name and citizenship of adoptive mother and father, and the date and place of their marriage, when applicable;

                <li>to seal the original certificate of birth in the civil registry records which can be opened only upon order of the court which issued the decree of adoption; and

                <li>to submit to the court issuing the decree of adoption proof of compliance with all the foregoing within thirty days from receipt of the decree.</ol></ol>
</ol>
            If the adoptee is a foundling, the court shall order the Civil Registrar where the foundling was registered, to annotate the decree of adoption on the foundling certificate and a new birth certificate shall be ordered prepared by the Civil Registrar in accordance with the decree.
<p></p>

            Sec. 17.  <i>Book of Adoptions.</i> &#8211; The Clerk of Court shall keep a book of adoptions showing the date of issuance of the decree in each case, compliance by the Civil Registrar with Section 16(B)(3) and all incidents arising after the issuance of the decree.

<p></p>
            Sec. 18.  <i>Confidential Nature of Proceedings and Records.</i> &#8211; All hearings in adoption cases, after compliance with the jurisdictional requirements shall be confidential and shall not be open to the public.  All records, books and papers relating to the adoption cases in the files of the court, the Department, or any other agency or institution participating in the adoption proceedings shall be kept strictly confidential.
<p></p>
            If the court finds that the disclosure of the information to a third person is necessary for security reasons or for purposes connected with or arising out of the adoption and will be for the best interests of the adoptee, the court may, upon proper motion, order the necessary information to be released, restricting the purposes for which it may be used.
<p></p>

            Sec. 19.  <i>Rescission of Adoption of the Adoptee.</i> &#8211; The petition shall be verified and filed by the adoptee who is over eighteen (18) years of age,  or with the assistance of the Department, if he is a minor, or if he is over eighteen (18) years of age but is incapacitated, by his guardian or counsel.
<p></p>
            The adoption may be rescinded based on any of the following grounds committed by the adopter:

            <ol type="1"><li>repeated physical and verbal maltreatment by the adopter despite having undergone counseling;

                <li>attempt on the life of the adoptee;

                <li>sexual assault or violence; or

                <li>abandonment or failure to comply with parental obligations. </ol>

            Adoption, being in the best interests of the child, shall not be subject to rescission by the adopter.  However, the adopter may disinherit the adoptee for causes provided in Article 919 of the Civil Code.
<p></p>

            Sec. 20.  <i>Venue.</i> &#8211; The petition shall be filed with the Family Court of the city or province where the adoptee resides.

            Sec. 22.  <i>Order to Answer.</i> &#8211; The court shall issue an order requiring the adverse party to answer the petition within fifteen (15) days from receipt of a copy thereof.

<p></p>
            The court shall order that the parental authority of the biological parent of the adoptee, if known, or the legal custody of the Department shall be restored if the adoptee is still a minor or incapacitated and declare that the reciprocal rights and obligations of the adopter and the adoptee to each other shall be extinguished.
<p></p>
            The court shall further declare that successional rights shall revert to its status prior to adoption, as of the date of judgment of judicial rescission.  Vested rights acquired prior to judicial rescission shall be respected.
<p></p>
            It shall also order the adoptee to use the name stated in his original birth or foundling certificate.
<p></p>
            The court shall further order the Civil Registrar where the adoption decree was registered to cancel the new birth certificate of the adoptee and reinstate his original birth or foundling certificate.
<p></p>

            Sec. 24.  <i>Service of Judgment.</i> &#8211; A certified true copy of the judgment together with a certificate of finality issued by the Branch Clerk of the Court which rendered the decision in accordance with the preceding Section shall be served by the petitioner upon the Civil Registrar concerned within thirty (30) days from receipt of the certificate of finality.  The Civil Registrar shall forthwith enter the rescission decree in the register and submit proof of compliance to the court issuing the decree and the Clerk of Court within thirty (30) days from receipt of the decree.
<p></p>
