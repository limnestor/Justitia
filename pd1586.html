            </CENTER>
            <div align="justify"><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the pursuit of a comprehensive and integrated environmental
                protection program necessitates the establishment and institutionalization of a system whereby the
                exigencies of socio-economic undertakings can be reconciled with the requirements of environmental
                quality; <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the regulatory requirements of Environmental Impact Statements and
                    Assessments instituted in pursuit of this national environmental protection program have to be
                    worked into their full regulatory and procedural details in a manner consistent with the goals of
                    the program.</p>
                <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS</strong>, President of the Philippines, by virtue of
                    the powers vested in me by the Constitution do hereby order and declare:</p>
                <p><strong>SECTION 1.</strong> <em>Policy.</em>—It is hereby declared the policy of the State to attain
                    and maintain a rational and orderly balance between socio-economic growth and environmental
                    protection.</p>
                <p><strong>SEC. 2.</strong> <em>Environmental Impact Statement System.</em>—There is hereby established
                    an Environmental Impact Statement System founded and based on the environmental impact statement
                    required, under Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1151, of all agencies and instrumentalities of
                    the national government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, as well as private
                    corporations, firms and entities, for every proposed project and undertaking which significantly
                    affect the quality of the environment.</p>
                <p><strong>SEC. 3.</strong> <em>Determination of Lead Agency.</em>—The Minister of Human Settlements or
                    his designated representative is hereby authorized to name the lead agencies referred to in Section
                    4 of Presidential Decree No. 1151 which shall have jurisdiction to undertake the preparation of the
                    necessary environmental impact statements on declared environmentally critical projects and areas.
                    All Environmental Impact Statements shall be submitted to the National Environmental Protection
                    Council for review and evaluation.</p>
                <p><strong>SEC. 4.</strong> <em>Presidential Proclamation of Environmentally Critical Areas and
                    Projects.</em>—The President of the Philippines may, on his own initiative or upon recommendation of
                    the National Environmental Protection Council, by proclamation declare certain projects,
                    undertakings or areas in the country as environmentally critical. No person, partnership or
                    corporation shall undertake or operate any such declared environmentally critical project or area
                    without first securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate issued by the President or his duly
                    authorized representative. For the proper management of said critical project or area, the President
                    may by his proclamation reorganize such government offices, agencies, institutions, corporations or
                    instrumentalities including the re-alignment of government personnel, and their specific functions
                    and responsibilities.</p>
                <p>For the same purpose as above, the Ministry of Human Settlements shall: (a) prepare the proper land
                    or water use pattern for said critical project (s) or area (s); (b) establish ambient environmental
                    quality standards; (c) develop a program of environmental enchancement or protective measures

                    Environmental Protection Council, thru the Ministry of Human Settlements may however require
                    non-critical projects and undertakings to provide additional environmental safeguards as it may deem

                <p><strong>SEC. 6.</strong> <em>Secretariat.</em>—The National Environmental Protection Council is
                    hereby authorized to constitute the necessary secretariat which will administer the Environmental
                    Impact Statement System and undertake the processing and evaluation of environmental impact

                    Settlements is hereby authorized to provide management and financial support to government offices

                    existing appropriation or from budgetary augmentation as the Minister of Human Settlements may deem
                    necessary.</p>
                <p><strong>SEC. 8.</strong> <em>Rules and Regulations.</em>—The National Environmental Protection
                    Council shall issue the necessary rules and regulations to implement this Decree. For this purpose,
                    the National Pollution Control Commission may be availed of as one of its implementing arms,

                    provided in P.D. No. 984.</p>
                <p><strong>SEC. 9.</strong> <em>Penalty for Violation.</em>—Any person, corporation or partnership found
                    violating Section 4 of this Decree, or the terms and conditions in the issuance of the Environmental

                <p><strong>SEC. 10.</strong> <em>Environmental Revolving Fund.</em>—Proceeds from the penalties
                    prescribed in the preceding Section 9 and other penalties imposed by the National Pollution Control
                    Commission as authorized in P.D. 984, shall be automatically appropriated into an Environment
