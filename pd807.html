Their decisions shall be final in case the penalty imposed is suspension for not more than thirty days or fine in an amount not exceeding thirty days&#8217; salary. In case the decision rendered by a bureau or office head is appealable to the Commission, the same may be initially appealed to the department and finally to the Commission and pending appeal, the same shall be executory except when the penalty is removal, in which case the same shall be executory only after confirmation by the department head.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) Administrative proceedings may be commenced against a subordinate officer or employee by the head of department or office of equivalent rank, or head of local government, or chiefs or agencies, regional directors, or upon sworn, written complaint of any other persons.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) In the case of a complaint filed by any other persons, the complainant shall submit sworn statements covering his testimony and those of his witnesses together with his documentary evidence. If on the basis of such papers a prima facie case is found not to exist, the disciplining authority shall dismiss the case. If a prima facie case exists, he shall notify the respondent in writing, of the charges against the latter, to which shall be attached copies of the complaint, sworn statements and other documents submitted, and the respondent shall be allowed not less than seventy-two hours after receipt of the complaint to answer the charges in writing under oath, together with supporting sworn statements and documents, in which he shall indicate whether or not he elects a formal investigation if his answer is not considered satisfactory. If the answer is found satisfactory, the disciplining authority shall dismiss the case.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) Although a respondent does not request a formal investigation, one shall nevertheless be conducted when from the allegations of the complaint and the answer of the respondent, including the supporting documents, the merits of the case cannot be decided judiciously without conducting such an investigation.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) The investigation shall be held not earlier than five days nor later than ten days from the date of receipt of respondent&#8217;s answer by the disciplining authority, and shall be finished within thirty days from the filling of the charges, unless the period is extended by the Commission in meritorious cases. The decision shall be rendered by the disciplining authority within thirty days from the termination of the investigation or submission of the report of the investigator, which report shall be submitted within fifteen days from the conclusion of the investigation.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(e) The direct evidence for the complainant and the respondent shall consist of the sworn statement and documents submitted in support of the complaint or answer, as the case may be, without prejudice to the presentation of additional evidence deemed necessary but was unavailable at the time of the filing of the complaint or answer, upon which the cross-examination, by respondent and the complainant, respectively, shall be based. Following cross-examination, there may be redirect and recross-examination.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(f) Either party may avail himself of the services of counsel and may require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence in his favor through the compulsory process of subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(g) The investigation shall be conducted only for the purpose of ascertaining the truth and without necessarily adhering to technical rules applicable in judicial proceedings. It shall be conducted by the disciplining authority concerned or his authorized representative.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The phrase &#8220;any other party&#8221; shall be understood to be a complainant other than those referred to in subsection (a) hereof.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 39. </strong><em>Appeals. </em>Appeals, where allowable, shall be made by the party adversely affected by the decision within fifteen days from receipt of the decision unless a petition for reconsideration is seasonably filed, which petition shall be decided within fifteen days. Notice of the appeal shall be filed with the disciplining office, which shall forward the records of the case, together with the notice of appeal, to the appellate authority within fifteen days from filing of the notice of appeal, with its comment, if any. The notice of appeal shall specifically state the date of the decision appealed from and the date of receipt thereof. It shall also specifically set forth clearly the grounds relied upon for excepting from the decision.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) A petition for reconsideration shall be based only on any of the following grounds: (1) new evidence has been discovered which materially affects the decision rendered; (2) the decision is not supported by the evidence on record; or (3) errors of law or irregularities have been committed prejudicial to the interest of the respondent: Provided, That only one petition for reconsideration shall be entertained.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 40. </strong><em>Summary Proceedings. </em>No formal investigation is necessary and the respondent may be immediately removed or dismissed if any of the following circumstances is present:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) When the charge is serious and the evidence of guilt is strong;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) When the respondent is a recidivist or has been repeatedly charged and there is reasonable ground to believe that he is guilty of the present charge.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) When the respondent is notoriously undesirable.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Resort to summary proceedings by disciplining authority shall be done with utmost objectivity and impartiality to the end that no injustice is committed: Provided, That removal or dismissal except those by the President, himself, or upon his order, may be appealed to the Commission.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 41. </strong><em>Preventive Suspension. </em>The proper disciplining authority may preventively suspend any subordinate officer or employee under his authority pending an investigation, in the charge against such officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct, or neglect in the performance of duty, or if there are reasons to believe that the respondent is guilty of charges which would warrant his removal from the service.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 42. </strong><em>Lifting of Preventive Suspension Pending Administrative Investigation. </em>When the administrative case against the officer of employee under preventive suspension is not finally decided by the disciplining authority within the period of ninety (90) days after the date of suspension of the respondent who is not a presidential appointee, the respondent shall be automatically reinstated in the service: Provided, That when the delay in the disposition of the case is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the respondent, the period of delay shall not be counted in computing the period of suspension herein provided.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Section 43. </strong><em>Removal of Administrative Penalties or Disabilities. </em>In meritorious cases and upon recommendation in the Commission, the President may commute or remove administrative penalties or disabilities imposed upon officers or employees in disciplinary cases, subject to such terms and conditions as he may impose in the interest of the service.</p>
