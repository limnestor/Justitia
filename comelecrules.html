                <p>(d) Simultaneously with the oral objection, the objecting party shall also enter his objection in the form for written objections to be prescribed by the Commission. Within twenty-four (24) hours from and after the presentation of such an objection, the objecting party shall submit the evidence in support of the objections, which shall be attached to the form for written objections.

                <p>(e) Upon receipt of the evidence, the Board shall take up the contested returns, consider the written objections thereto and opposition, if any, and summarily and immediately rule thereon. The Board shall enter its ruling on the prescribed form and authenticate the same by the signature of its members.</p>

Within forty-eight (48) hours therefrom, any party adversely affected by the ruling may file with the Board a written and verified Notice to Appeal; and within an inextendible period of five (5) days thereafter, an appeal may be taken to the Commission.</p>
                <p>Immediately upon receipt of the Notice of Appeal, the Board shall make an appropriate report to the Commission, elevating therewith the complete records and evidence submitted in the canvass, furnishing the parties with the copies of the report.</p>
                <p>(h) On the basis of the records and evidence elevated to it by the Board, the Commission en banc shall decide summarily the appeal within seven (7) days from the receipt of said records and evidence.

Any proclamation in violation hereof shall be void ab initio, unless the contested returns will not adversely affect the uncontested results of the elections.</p>
                <p>(j) If in the course of the canvass the boards&#8217; copy of the election returns is missing, the board shall, by messenger or otherwise obtain such missing returns from the board of election inspectors concerned, or if said returns have been lost or destroyed, the board of canvassers, upon prior authority of the Commission, may use any of the authentic copies of said election returns or a certified true copy of said election returns issued by the Commission.</p>
                <p>(k) If it clearly appears that some requisites in form or data had been omitted in the election returns, the Board of Canvassers shall call for all the members of the board of election inspectors concerned by the most expeditious means, for said board to effect the correction: provided that in case the omission in the election return is that of the name of any candidate and/or his corresponding votes, the board of canvassers shall require the board of election inspectors concerned to complete the necessary data in the election returns and affix therein their initials: Provided, further, that if the votes omitted in the returns cannot be ascertained by other means except by recounting the votes, the board of canvassers shall immediately make a report thereon to the Commission and the latter, after satisfying itself that the identity and integrity of the ballot box have not been violated, shall order the board of election inspectors to open the ballot box, and, also after satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has been duly preserved, order the broad of election inspectors to count the votes for the candidates whose votes have been omitted with notice thereof to all candidates for the position involved and thereafter complete the returns.</p>
                <p>(l) When the board of canvassers determines that the election returns submitted to it appear to be tampered with, altered or falsified after they have left the hands of the board of inspectors, or otherwise not authentic or were prepared by the board of election inspectors under duress, force, or intimidation, or prepared by persons other than the members of the board of election inspectors, the board of canvassers shall use the other copies of said election returns, and if necessary, the copy inside the ballot box which, upon prior authority of the Commission, may be retrieve. If the other copies of the returns are likewise tampered with, altered, falsified, not authentic, prepared under duress, force, intimidation, or prepared by persons other than the members of the board of election inspectors, the board of canvassers shall immediately bring the matter to the attention of the Commission. The Commission shall then, after giving notice to all candidates concerned and after satisfying itself that nothing in the ballot box indicates that its identity and integrity have been violated, order the opening of the ballot box and, likewise after satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has been duly preserved, shall order the board of inspectors concerned to recount the votes of the candidates affected and when proper, to prepare a new return which shall then be used by the board of canvassers as basis of the canvass.</p>
                <p>(m) In case it appears to the board of canvassers that there exists discrepancies in the other authentic copies of the election returns from a precinct or discrepancies in the votes of any candidate in words and figures in the same returns, and in either case the difference affects the results of the election, the Commission, upon motion of the board of canvassers or any candidate affected and after due notice to all candidates concerned, shall proceed summarily to determine whether the integrity of the ballot box had been preserved, and once satisfied thereof shall order the opening of the ballot box to recount the votes cast in the precinct solely for the purpose of determining the true result of the count of votes of the candidates concerned.</p>
                <p>(n) When the evidence submitted to the board of canvassers indicate a failure of elections in a precinct or precincts and the number of registered voters therein would affect the final result of the election, the board of canvassers shall bring the matter to the attention of the Commission. Until this issue is resolved the board of canvassers shall suspend the proclamation of any candidate.</p>
