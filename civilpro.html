                RULES OF COURT
                Pursuant to the provisions of [S]ection 5(5) of Article VIII of the Constitution, the Supreme Court hereby
                adopts and promulgates the following rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional
                rights, pleading, practice and procedure in all courts, the admission to the practice of law, the Integrated
                Bar, and legal assistance to the underprivileged:
                RULE 1
                GENERAL PROVISIONS
                Section 1. Title of the Rules. – These Rules shall be known and cited as the Rules of Court. (1)
                Section 2. In what courts applicable. – These Rules shall apply in all the courts, except as otherwise
                provided by the Supreme Court. (n)
                Section 3. Cases governed. – These Rules shall govern the procedure to be observed in actions, civil or
                criminal, and special proceedings.
                (a) A civil action is one by which a party sues another for the enforcement or protection of a
                right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong. (1a, R2)
                A civil action may either be ordinary or special. Both are governed by the rules for ordinary
                civil actions, subject to the specific rules prescribed for a special civil action. (n)
                (b) A criminal action is one by which the State prosecutes a person for an act or omission
                punishable by law. (n)
                (c) A special proceeding is a remedy by which a party seeks to establish a status, a right, or a
                particular fact. (2a, R2)
                Section 4. In what cases not applicable. – These Rules shall not apply to election cases, land registration,
                cadastral, naturalization and insolvency proceedings, and other cases not herein provided for, except by
                analogy or in a suppletory character and whenever practicable and convenient. (R143a)
                Section 5. Commencement of action. – A civil action is commenced by the filing of the original complaint
                in court. If an additional defendant is impleaded in a later pleading, the action is commenced with
                regard to him on the date of the filing of such later pleading, irrespective of whether the motion for its
                admission, if necessary, is denied by the court. (6a)
                Section 6. Construction. – These Rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote their objective of
                securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding. (2a)
                CIVIL ACTIONS
                ORDINARY CIVIL ACTIONS
                RULE 2
                CAUSE OF ACTION
                Section 1. Ordinary civil actions, basis of. – Every ordinary civil action must be based on a cause of
                action. (n)
                Section 2. Cause of action, defined. – A cause of action is the act or omission by which a party violates
                a right of another. (n)
                Section 3. One suit for a single cause of action. – A party may not institute more than one suit for a single
                cause of action. (3a)
                Section 4. Splitting a single cause of action; effect of. – If two or more suits are instituted on the basis
                of the same cause of action, the filing of one or a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a
                ground for the dismissal of the others. (4a)
                Section 5. Joinder of causes of action. – A party may in one pleading assert, in the alternative or otherwise,
                as many causes of action as he may have against an opposing party, subject to the following conditions:
                (a) The party joining the causes of action shall comply with the rules on joinder of parties;
                (b) The joinder shall not include special civil actions or actions governed by special rules;
                (c) Where the causes of action are between the same parties but pertain to different venues or
                jurisdictions, the joinder may be allowed in the Regional Trial Court provided one of the
                causes of action falls within the jurisdiction of said court and the venue lies therein; and
                (d) Where the claims in all the causes of action are principally for recovery of money, the
                aggregate amount claimed shall be the test of jurisdiction. (5a)
                Section 6. Misjoinder of causes of action. – Misjoinder of causes of action is not a ground for dismissal
                of an action. A misjoined cause of action may, on motion of a party or on the initiative of the court, be
                severed and proceeded with separately. (n)
                RULE 3
                PARTIES TO CIVIL ACTIONS
                Section 1. Who may be parties; plaintiff and defendant. – Only natural or juridical persons, or entities
                authorized by law may be parties in a civil action. The term “plaintiff” may refer to the claiming party,
                the counter-claimant, the cross-claimant, or the third (fourth, etc.)[-]party plaintiff. The term “defendant”
                may refer to the original defending party, the defendant in a counterclaim, the cross-defendant, or the
                third (fourth, etc.)[-]party defendant. (1a)
                Section 2. Parties in interest. – A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured
                by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. Unless otherwise authorized
                by law or these Rules, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in
                interest. (2a)
                Section 3. Representatives as parties. – Where the action is allowed to be prosecuted or defended by
                a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary shall be included in the title
                of the case and shall be deemed to be the real party in interest. A representative may be a trustee of an
                express trust, a guardian, an executor or administrator, or a party authorized by law or these Rules. An
                agent acting in his own name and for the benefit of an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued without
                joining the principal except when the contract involves things belonging to the principal. (3a)
                Section 4. Spouses as parties. – Husband and wife shall sue or be sued jointly, except as provided by
                law. (4a)
                Section 5. Minor or incompetent persons. – A minor or a person alleged to be incompetent, may sue or
                be sued, with the assistance of his father, mother, guardian, or if he has none, a guardian ad litem. (5a)
                Section 6. Permissive joinder of parties. – All persons in whom or against whom any right to relief in
                respect to or arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions is alleged to exist, whether
                jointly, severally, or in the alternative, may, except as otherwise provided in these Rules, join as plaintiffs
                or be joined as defendants in one complaint, where any question of law or fact common to all such
                plaintiffs or to all such defendants may arise in the action; but the court may make such orders as may be
                just to prevent any plaintiff or defendant from being embarrassed or put to expense in connection with
                any proceedings in which he may have no interest. (6)
                Section 7. Compulsory joinder of indispensable parties. – Parties in interest without whom no final
                determination can be had of an action shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants. (7)
                Section 8. Necessary party. – A necessary party is one who is not indispensable but who ought to
                be joined as a party if complete relief is to be accorded as to those already parties, or for a complete
                determination or settlement of the claim subject of the action. (8a)
                Section 9. Non-joinder of necessary parties to be pleaded. – Whenever in any pleading in which a claim
                is asserted a necessary party is not joined, the pleader shall set forth his name, if known, and shall state
                why he is omitted. Should the court find the reason for the omission unmeritorious, it may order the
                inclusion of the omitted necessary party if jurisdiction over his person may be obtained.
                The failure to comply with the order for his inclusion, without justifiable cause, shall be deemed
                a waiver of the claim against such party.
                The non-inclusion of a necessary party does not prevent the court from proceeding in the
                action, and the judgment rendered therein shall be without prejudice to the rights of such necessary
                party. (8a, 9a)
                Section 10. Unwilling co-plaintiff. – If the consent of any party who should be joined as plaintiff can not
                be obtained, he may be made a defendant and the reason therefor shall be stated in the complaint. (10)
                Section 11. Misjoinder and non-joinder of parties. – Neither misjoinder nor non-joinder of parties is
                ground for dismissal of an action. Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of
                any party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just. Any claim
                against a misjoined party may be severed and proceeded with separately. (11a)
                Section 12. Class suit. – When the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest
                to many persons so numerous that it is impracticable to join all as parties, a number of them which the
                court finds to be sufficiently numerous and representative as to fully protect the interests of all concerned
                may sue or defend for the benefit of all. Any party in interest shall have the right to intervene to protect
                his individual interest. (12a)
                Section 13. Alternative defendants. – Where the plaintiff is uncertain against who of several persons he
                is entitled to relief, he may join any or all of them as defendants in the alternative, although a right to
                relief against one may be inconsistent with a right of relief against the other. (13a)
                Section 14. Unknown identity or name of defendant. – Whenever the identity or name of a defendant
                is unknown, he may be sued as the unknown owner, heir, devisee, or by such other designation as
                the case may require; when his identity or true name is discovered, the pleading must be amended
                accordingly. (14)
                Section 15. Entity without juridical personality as defendant. – When two or more persons not organized
                as an entity with juridical personality enter into a transaction, they may be sued under the name by which
                they are generally or commonly known.
                In the answer of such defendant, the names and addresses of the persons composing said entity
                must all be revealed. (15a)
                Section 16. Death of party; duty of counsel. – Whenever a party to a pending action dies, and the claim
                is not thereby extinguished, it shall be the duty of his counsel to inform the court within thirty (30)
                days after such death of the fact thereof, and to give the name and address of his legal representative or
                representatives. Failure of counsel to comply with this duty shall be a ground for disciplinary action.
                The heirs of the deceased may be allowed to be substituted for the deceased, without requiring
                the appointment of an executor or administrator and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the
                minor heirs.
The court shall forthwith order said legal representative or representatives to appear and be
substituted within a period of thirty (30) days from notice.
If no legal representative is named by the counsel for the deceased party, or if the one so named
shall fail to appear within the specified period, the court may order the opposing party, within a specified
time, to procure the appointment of an executor or administrator for the estate of the deceased and the
latter shall immediately appear for and on behalf of the deceased. The court charges in procuring such
appointment, if defrayed by the opposing party, may be recovered as costs. (16a, 17a)
Section 17. Death or separation of a party who is a public officer. – When a public officer is a party in
an action in his official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office,
the action may be continued and maintained by or against his successor if, within thirty (30) days after
the successor takes office or such time as may be granted by the court, it is satisfactorily shown to the
court by any party that there is a substantial need for continuing or maintaining it and that the successor
adopts or continues or threatens to adopt or continue the action of his predecessor. Before a substitution
is made, the party or officer to be affected, unless expressly assenting thereto, shall be given reasonable
notice of the application therefor and accorded an opportunity to be heard. (18a)
Section 18. Incompetency or incapacity. – If a party becomes incompetent or incapacitated, the court,
upon motion with notice, may allow the action to be continued by or against the incompetent or
incapacitated person assisted by his legal guardian or guardian ad litem. (19a)
Section 19. Transfer of interest. – In case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by
or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is
transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party. (20)
Section 20. Action on contractual money claims. – When the action is for recovery of money arising
from contract, express or implied, and the defendant dies before entry of final judgment in the court in
which the action was pending at the time of such death, it shall not be dismissed but shall instead be
allowed to continue until entry of final judgment. A favorable judgment obtained by the plaintiff therein
shall be enforced in the manner especially provided in these Rules for prosecuting claims against the
estate of a deceased person. (21a)
Section 21. Indigent party. – A party may be authorized to litigate his action, claim or defense as an
indigent if the court, upon an ex parte application and hearing, is satisfied that the party is one who has
no money or property sufficient and available for food, shelter and basic necessities for himself and his
family.
Such authority shall include an exemption from payment of docket and other lawful fees, and
of transcripts of stenographic notes which the court may order to be furnished him. The amount of
the docket and other lawful fees which the indigent was exempted from paying shall be a lien on any
judgment rendered in the case favorable to the indigent, unless the court otherwise provides.
Any adverse party may contest the grant of such authority at any time before judgment is rendered
by the trial court. If the court should determine after hearing that the party declared as an indigent is
in fact a person with sufficient income or property, the proper docket and other lawful fees shall be
assessed and collected by the clerk of court. If payment is not made within the time fixed by the court,
execution shall issue or the payment thereof, without prejudice to such other sanctions as the court
may impose. (22a)
Section 22. Notice to the Solicitor General. – In any action involving the validity of any treaty, law,
ordinance, executive order, presidential decree, rules or regulations, the court, in its discretion, may
require the appearance of the Solicitor General who may be heard in person or through a representative
duly designated by him. (23a)
RULE 4
VENUE OF ACTIONS
Section 1. Venue of real actions. – Actions affecting title to or possession of real property, or interest
therein, shall be commenced and tried in the proper court which has jurisdiction over the area wherein
the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated.
Forcible entry and detainer actions shall be commenced and tried in the municipal trial court of
the municipality or city wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated. (1[a], 2[a]a)
Section 2. Venue of personal actions. – All other actions may be commenced and tried where the
plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs resides, or where the defendant or any of the principal
defendants resides, or in the case of a nonresident defendant where he may be found, at the election of
the plaintiff. (2[b]a)
Section 3. Venue of actions against nonresidents. – If any of the defendants does not reside and is not
found in the Philippines, and the action affects the personal status of the plaintiff, or any property of said
defendant located in the Philippines, the action may be commenced and tried in the court of the place
where the plaintiff resides, or where the property or any portion thereof is situated or found. (2[c]a)
Section 4. When Rule not applicable. – This Rule shall not apply-
(a) In those cases where a specific rule or law provides otherwise; or
(b) Where the parties have validly agreed in writing before the filing of the action on the exclusive
venue thereof. (3a, 5a)
RULE 5
UNIFORM PROCEDURE IN TRIAL COURTS
Section 1. Uniform procedure. – The procedure in the Municipal Trial Courts shall be the same as in
the Regional Trial Courts, except (a) where a particular provision expressly or impliedly applies only to
either of said courts, or (b) in civil cases governed by the Rule on Summary Procedure. (n)

RULE 6
KINDS OF PLEADINGS
Section 1. Pleadings defined. – Pleadings are the written statements of the respective claims and defenses
of the parties submitted to the court for appropriate judgment. (1)
Section 2. Pleadings allowed. – The claims of a party are asserted in a complaint, counterclaim, crossclaim,
third (fourth, etc.)-party complaint, or complaint-in-intervention.
The defenses of a party are alleged in the answer to the pleading asserting a claim against him
or her.
An answer may be responded to by a reply only if the defending party attaches an actionable
document to the answer. (2a)
Section 3. Complaint. – The complaint is the pleading alleging the plaintiff’s or claiming party’s cause
or causes of action. The names and residences of the plaintiff and defendant must be stated in the
complaint. (3a)
Section 4. Answer. – An answer is a pleading in which a defending party sets forth his or her defenses. (4a)
Section 5. Defenses. – Defenses may either be negative or affirmative.
(a) A negative defense is the specific denial of the material fact or facts alleged in the pleading
of the claimant essential to his or her cause or causes of action.
(b) An affirmative defense is an allegation of a new matter which, while hypothetically admitting
the material allegations in the pleading of the claimant, would nevertheless prevent or bar
recovery by him or her. The affirmative defenses include fraud, statute of limitations, release,
payment, illegality, statute of frauds, estoppel, former recovery, discharge in bankruptcy, and
any other matter by way of confession and avoidance.
Affirmative defenses may also include grounds for the dismissal of a complaint, specifically,
that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, that there is another action
pending between the same parties for the same cause, or that the action is barred by a prior
judgment. (5a)
Section 6. Counterclaim. – A counterclaim is any claim which a defending party may have against an
opposing party. (6)
Section 7. Compulsory counterclaim. – A compulsory counterclaim is one which, being cognizable by
the regular courts of justice, arises out of or is connected with the transaction or occurrence constituting
the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence
of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Such a counterclaim must be within the
jurisdiction of the court both as to the amount and the nature thereof, except that in an original action
before the Regional Trial Court, the counterclaim may be considered compulsory regardless of the
amount. A compulsory counterclaim not raised in the same action is barred, unless otherwise allowed
by these Rules. (7a)
Section 8. Cross-claim. – A cross-claim is any claim by one party against a co-party arising out of the
transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter either of the original action or of a counterclaim
therein. Such cross-claim may cover all or part of the original claim. (8a)
Section 9. Counter-counterclaims and counter-cross-claims. – A counterclaim may be asserted against
an original counter-claimant.
A cross-claim may also be filed against an original cross-claimant. (9)
Section 10. Reply. – All new matters alleged in the answer are deemed controverted. If the plaintiff
wishes to interpose any claims arising out of the new matters so alleged, such claims shall be set forth
in an amended or supplemental complaint. However, the plaintiff may file a reply only if the defending
party attaches an actionable document to his or her answer.
A reply is a pleading, the office or function of which is to deny, or allege facts in denial or
avoidance of new matters alleged in, or relating to, said actionable document.
In the event of an actionable document attached to the reply, the defendant may file a rejoinder
if the same is based solely on an actionable document. (10a)
Section 11. Third, (fourth, etc.)‑party complaint. – A third (fourth, etc.)-party complaint is a claim that a
defending party may, with leave of court, file against a person not a party to the action, called the third
(fourth, etc.)-party defendant, for contribution, indemnity, subrogation or any other relief, in respect of
his or her opponent’s claim.
The third (fourth, etc.)-party complaint shall be denied admission, and the court shall require
the defendant to institute a separate action, where: (a) the third (fourth, etc.)-party defendant cannot be
located within thirty (30) calendar days from the grant of such leave; (b) matters extraneous to the issue
in the principal case are raised; or (c) the effect would be to introduce a new and separate controversy
into the action. (11a)
Section 12. Bringing new parties. – When the presence of parties other than those to the original action
is required for the granting of complete relief in the determination of a counterclaim or cross-claim, the
court shall order them to be brought in as defendants, if jurisdiction over them can be obtained. (12)
Section 13. Answer to third (fourth, etc.)-party complaint. – A third (fourth, etc.)-party defendant may
allege in his or her answer his or her defenses, counterclaims or cross-claims, including such defenses
that the third (fourth, etc.)-party plaintiff may have against the original plaintiff’s claim. In proper cases,
he [or she] may also assert a counterclaim against the original plaintiff in respect of the latter’s claim
against the third-party plaintiff. (13a)
RULE 7
PARTS AND CONTENTS OF A PLEADING
Section 1. Caption. – The caption sets forth the name of the court, the title of the action, and the docket
number if assigned.
The title of the action indicates the names of the parties. They shall all be named in the original
complaint or petition; but in subsequent pleadings, it shall be sufficient if the name of the first party on
each side be stated with an appropriate indication when there are other parties.
Their respective participation in the case shall be indicated. (1)
Section 2. The body. – The body of the pleading sets forth its designation, the allegations of the party’s
claims or defenses, the relief prayed for, and the date of the pleading.
(a) Paragraphs. – The allegations in the body of a pleading shall be divided into paragraphs so
numbered as to be readily identified, each of which shall contain a statement of a single set
of circumstances so far as that can be done with convenience. A paragraph may be referred
to by its number in all succeeding pleadings.
(b) Headings. – When two or more causes of action are joined, the statement of the first shall be
prefaced by the words “first cause of action,” of the second by “second cause of action,” and
so on for the others.
When one or more paragraphs in the answer are addressed to one of several causes of action
in the complaint, they shall be prefaced by the words “answer to the first cause of action”
or “answer to the second cause of action” and so on; and when one or more paragraphs of
the answer are addressed to several causes of action, they shall be prefaced by words to that
effect.
(c) Relief. – The pleading shall specify the relief sought, but it may add a general prayer for such
further or other relief as may be deemed just or equitable.
(d) Date. – Every pleading shall be dated. (4)
Section 3. Signature and address. – (a) Every pleading [and other written submissions to the court] must
be signed by the party or counsel representing him or her.
(b) The signature of counsel constitutes a certificate by him or her that he or she has read the pleading
and document; that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
reasonable under the circumstances:
(1) It is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary
delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;
(2) The claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or
jurisprudence, or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing
jurisprudence;
(3) The factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely
have evidentiary support after availment of the modes of discovery under these [R]ules; and
(4) The denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so
identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.
(c) If the court determines, on motion or motu proprio and after notice and hearing, that this [R]ule
has been violated, it may impose an appropriate sanction or refer such violation to the proper office
for disciplinary action, on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule, or is responsible for
the violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly and severally liable
for a violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee. The sanction may include, but shall
not be limited to, non-monetary directive or sanction; an order to pay a penalty in court; or, if imposed
on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of part or
all of the reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation, including
attorney’s fees for the filing of the motion for sanction. The lawyer or law firm cannot pass on the
monetary penalty to the client. (3a)
Section 4. Verification. – Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not
be under oath or verified.
A pleading is verified by an affidavit of an affiant duly authorized to sign said verification. The
authorization of the affiant to act on behalf of a party, whether in the form of a secretary’s certificate or a
special power of attorney, should be attached to the pleading, and shall allege the following attestations:
(a) The allegations in the pleading are true and correct based on his or her personal knowledge,
or based on authentic documents;
(b) The pleading is not filed to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost
of litigation; and
(c) The factual allegations therein have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will
likewise have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for discovery.
The signature of the affiant shall further serve as a certification of the truthfulness of the allegations
in the pleading.
A pleading required to be verified that contains a verification based on “information and belief,”
or upon “knowledge, information and belief,” or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as an
unsigned pleading. (4a)
Section 5. Certification against forum shopping. – The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under
oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification
annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he [or she] has not theretofore commenced
any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency
and, to the best of his [or her] knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there
is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he
[or she] should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he
[or she] shall report that fact within five (5) calendar days therefrom to the court wherein his [or her]
aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.
The authorization of the affiant to act on behalf of a party, whether in the form of a secretary’s
certificate or a special power of attorney, should be attached to the pleading.
Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the
complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice,
unless otherwise provided, upon motion and after hearing. The submission of a false certification or
non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without
prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions. If the acts of the party or his [or her]
counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary
dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative
sanctions. (5a)
Section 6. Contents. – Every pleading stating a party’s claims or defenses shall, in addition to those
mandated by Section 2, Rule 7, state the following:
(a) Names of witnesses who will be presented to prove a party’s claim or defense;
(b) Summary of the witnesses’ intended testimonies, provided that the judicial affidavits of said
witnesses shall be attached to the pleading and form an integral part thereof. Only witnesses
whose judicial affidavits are attached to the pleading shall be presented by the parties during
trial. Except if a party presents meritorious reasons as basis for the admission of additional
witnesses, no other witness or affidavit shall be heard or admitted by the court; and
(c) Documentary and object evidence in support of the allegations contained in the pleading. (n)

If a cause of action [or] defense relied on is based on law, the pertinent provisions thereof and
their applicability to him or her shall be clearly and concisely stated. (1a)
Section 2. Alternative causes of action or defenses. – A party may set forth two or more statements of a
claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in one cause of action or defense or in separate
causes of action or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them
if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of
one or more of the alternative statements. (2)
Section 3. Conditions precedent. – In any pleading, a general averment of the performance or occurrence
of all conditions precedent shall be sufficient. (3)
Section 4. Capacity. – Facts showing the capacity of a party to sue or be sued or the authority of a

knowledge. (4)
Section 5. Fraud, mistake, condition of the mind. – In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances
constituting fraud or mistake must be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge or other
condition of the mind of a person may be averred generally. (5)
Section 6. Judgment. – In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or foreign court, judicial or
quasi-judicial tribunal, or of a board or officer, it is sufficient to aver the judgment or decision without
setting forth matter showing jurisdiction to render it. An authenticated copy of the judgment or decision
shall be attached to the pleading. (6a)
Section 7. Action or defense based on document. – Whenever an action or defense is based upon a
written instrument or document, the substance of such instrument or document shall be set forth in the
pleading, and the original or a copy thereof shall be attached to the pleading as an exhibit, which shall
be deemed to be a part of the pleading. (7a)
Section 8. How to contest such documents. – When an action or defense is founded upon a written
instrument, or attached to the corresponding pleading as provided in the preceding section, the genuineness
and due execution of the instrument shall be deemed admitted unless the adverse party, under oath
specifically denies them, and sets forth what he or she claims to be the facts; but the requirement of
an oath does not apply when the adverse party does not appear to be a party to the instrument or when
compliance with an order for an inspection of the original instrument is refused. (8a)
Section 9. Official document or act. – In pleading an official document or official act, it is sufficient to
aver that the document was issued or the act was done in compliance with law. (9)
Section 10. Specific denial. – A defendant must specify each material allegation of fact the truth of which
he or she does not admit and, whenever practicable, shall set forth the substance of the matters upon
which he or she relies to support his or her denial. Where a defendant desires to deny only a part of an
averment, he or she shall specify so much of it as is true and material and shall deny only the remainder.
Where a defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of a
material averment made [to] the complaint, he or she shall so state, and this shall have the effect of a
denial. (10a)
Section 11. Allegations not specifically denied deemed admitted. – Material averments in a pleading
asserting a claim or claims, other than those as to the amount of unliquidated damages, shall be deemed
admitted when not specifically denied. (11a)
Section 12. Affirmative defenses. – (a) A defendant shall raise his or her affirmative defenses in his or
her answer, which shall be limited to the reasons set forth under Section 5(b), Rule 6, and the following
grounds:
1. That the court has no jurisdiction over the person of the defending party;
2. That venue is improperly laid;
3. That the plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue;
4. That the pleading asserting the claim states no cause of action; and
5. That a condition precedent for filing the claim has not been complied with.
(b) Failure to raise the affirmative defenses at the earliest opportunity shall constitute a waiver thereof.
(c) The court shall motu proprio resolve the above affirmative defenses within thirty (30) calendar days
from the filing of the answer.
(d) As to the other affirmative defenses under the first paragraph of Section 5(b), Rule 6, the court
may conduct a summary hearing within fifteen (15) calendar days from the filing of the answer. Such
affirmative defenses shall be resolved by the court within thirty (30) calendar days from the termination
of the summary hearing.
(e) Affirmative defenses, if denied, shall not be the subject of a motion for reconsideration or petition
for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus, but may be among the matters to be raised on appeal after a
judgment on the merits. (n)
Section 13. Striking out of pleading or matter contained therein. – Upon motion made by a party before
responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is permitted by these Rules, upon motion made by

court’s own initiative at any time, the court may order any pleading to be stricken out or that any sham
or false, redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter be stricken out therefrom. (12a)
RULE 9
EFFECT OF FAILURE TO PLEAD
Section 1. Defenses and objections not pleaded. – Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion
to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived. However, when it appears from the pleadings or the

by statute of limitations, the court shall dismiss the claim. (1)

therefor, the court shall, upon motion of the claiming party with notice to the defending party, and proof
of such failure, declare the defending party in default. Thereupon, the court shall proceed to render
judgment granting the claimant such relief as his or her pleading may warrant, unless the court in its
discretion requires the claimant to submit evidence. Such reception of evidence may be delegated to the
clerk of court.
(a) Effect of order of default. – A party in default shall be entitled to notice[s] of subsequent
proceedings but shall not to take part in the trial.
(b) Relief from order of default. – A party declared in default may at any time after notice thereof
and before judgment, file a motion under oath to set aside the order of default upon proper
showing that his or her failure to answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable
negligence and that he or she has a meritorious defense. In such case, the order of default
may be set aside on such terms and conditions as the judge may impose in the interest of
justice.
(c) Effect of partial default. – When a pleading asserting a claim states a common cause of action
against several defending parties, some of whom answer and the others fail to do so, the
court shall try the case against all upon the answers thus filed and render judgment upon the
evidence presented.
(d) Extent of relief to be awarded. – A judgment rendered against a party in default shall [neither]
exceed the amount or be different in kind from that prayed for nor award unliquidated
damages.
(e) Where no defaults allowed. – If the defending party in action for annulment or declaration of
nullity of marriage or for legal separation fails to answer, the court shall order the Solicitor
General or his or her deputized public prosecutor, to investigate whether or not a collusion
between the parties exists, and if there is no collusion, to intervene for the State in order to
see to it that the evidence submitted is not fabricated. (3a)

Section 4. Appearance of [p]arties. – It shall be the duty of the parties and their counsel to appear at the
pre-trial, court-annexed mediation, and judicial dispute resolution, if necessary. The non-appearance of

enter into an amicable settlement, to submit to alternative modes of dispute resolution, and to enter into
stipulations or admissions of facts and documents.

appear without valid cause when so required[,] pursuant to the next preceding [S]ection, shall cause the
dismissal of the action. The dismissal shall be with prejudice, unless otherwise ordered by the court. A
similar failure on the part of the defendant and counsel shall be cause to allow the plaintiff to present his

attending, including reasonable attorney’s fees. (24a)

objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition.

service of such interrogatories, the court on motion and notice, may strike out all or any part of any
pleading of that party, or dismiss the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or enter a judgment by
default against that party, and in its discretion, order him or her to pay reasonable expenses incurred by

Section 7. Partial new trial or reconsideration. – If the grounds for a motion under this Rule appear to
the court to affect the issues as to only a part, or less than all of the matter in controversy, or only one, or
less than all, of the parties to it, the court may order a new trial or grant reconsideration as to such issues
if severable without interfering with the judgment or final order upon the rest. (6a)
Section 8. Effect of order for partial new trial. – When less than all of the issues are ordered retried, the
court may either enter a judgment or final order as to the rest, or stay the enforcement of such judgment
or final order until after the new trial. (7a)
Section 9. Remedy against order denying a motion for new trial or reconsideration. – An order denying a
motion for new trial or reconsideration is not appealable, the remedy being an appeal from the judgment

constituting the petitioner’s good and substantial cause of action or defense, as the case may be. (3)
Section 4. Order to file an answer. – If the petition is sufficient in form and substance to justify relief,

dismissed or the petitioner fails on the trial of the case upon its merits, he will pay the adverse party all

motion, upon a judgment or order that disposes of the action or proceeding upon the expiration of the
period to appeal therefrom if no appeal has been duly perfected. (1a)
If the appeal has been duly perfected and finally resolved, the execution may forthwith be applied
for in the court of origin, on motion of the judgment obligee, submitting therewith certified true copies
of the judgment or judgments or final order or orders sought to be enforced and of the entry thereof, with
notice to the adverse party.

direct the court of origin to issue the writ of execution. (As amended by Cir. No. 24-94.)
Section 2. Discretionary execution. –
(a) Execution of a judgment or final order pending appeal. – On motion of the prevailing party with

of either the original record or the record on appeal, as the case may be, at the time of the filing of such
motion, said court may, in its discretion, order execution of a judgment or final order even before the
expiration of the period to appeal.
After the trial court has lost jurisdiction, the motion for execution pending appeal may be filed
in the appellate court.
Discretionary execution may only issue upon good reasons to be stated in a special order after

against on motion with notice to the surety. (3a)
Section 4. Judgments not stayed by appeal. – Judgments in actions for injunction, receivership, accounting

proper for the security or protection of the rights of the adverse party. (4a)
Section 5. Effect of reversal of executed judgment. – Where the executed judgment is reversed totally

property, the same may be sold for the satisfaction of the judgment obligation, and the officer
making the sale shall account to the corresponding executor or administrator for any surplus
in his hands. (7a)
Section 8. Issuance, form and contents of a writ of execution. – The writ of execution shall: (1) issue in
the name of the Republic of the Philippines from the court which granted the motion; (2) state the name
of the court, the case number and title, the dispositive part of the subject judgment or order; and (3)
require the sheriff or other proper officer to whom it is directed to enforce the writ according to its terms,
in the manner hereinafter provided:
(a) If the execution be against the property of the judgment obligor, to satisfy the judgment, with
interest, out of the real or personal property of such judgment obligor;
(b) If it be against real or personal property in the hands of personal representatives, heirs,
devisees, legatees, tenants, or trustees of the judgment obligor, to satisfy the judgment, with
interest, out of such property;
(c) If it be for the sale of real or personal property, to sell such property, describing it, and apply

real property; and
(e) In all cases, the writ of execution shall specifically state the amount of the interest, costs,
damages, rents, or profits due as of the date of the issuance of the writ, aside from the principal
obligation under the judgment. For this purpose, the motion for execution shall specify the
amounts of the foregoing reliefs sought by the movant. (8a)
Section 9. Execution of judgments for money, how enforced. – (a) Immediate payment on demand. – The
officer shall enforce an execution of a judgment for money by demanding from the judgment obligor the
immediate payment of the full amount stated in the writ of execution and all lawful fees. The judgment
obligor shall pay in cash, certified bank check payable to the judgment obligee, or any other form of
payment acceptable to the latter, the amount of the judgment debt under proper receipt directly to the
judgment obligee or his authorized representative if present at the time of payment. The lawful fees shall
be handed under proper receipt to the executing sheriff who shall turn over the said amount within the
same day to the clerk of court of the court that issued the writ.
If the judgment obligee or his authorized representative is not present to receive payment, the
judgment obligor shall deliver the aforesaid payment to the executing sheriff. The latter shall turn over
all the amounts coming into his possession within the same day to the clerk of court of the court that
issued the writ, or if the same is not practicable, deposit said amounts to a fiduciary account in the
nearest government depository bank of the Regional Trial Court of the locality.
The clerk of said court shall thereafter arrange for the remittance of the deposit to the account
of the court that issued the writ whose clerk of court shall then deliver said payment to the judgment
obligee in satisfaction of the judgment. The excess, if any, shall be delivered to the judgment obligor
while the lawful fees shall be retained by the clerk of court for disposition as provided by law. In no case
shall the executing sheriff demand that any payment by check be made payable to him.
(b) Satisfaction by levy. – If the judgment obligor cannot pay all or part of the obligation in cash, certified
bank check or other mode of payment acceptable to the judgment obligee, the officer shall levy upon the
properties of the judgment obligor of every kind and nature whatsoever which may be disposed of for
value and not otherwise exempt from execution giving the latter the option to immediately choose which
property or part thereof may be levied upon, sufficient to satisfy the judgment. If the judgment obligor
does not exercise the option, the officer shall first levy on the personal properties, if any, and then on the
real properties if the personal properties are insufficient to answer for the judgment.
The sheriff shall sell only a sufficient portion of the personal or real property of the judgment
obligor which has been levied upon.
When there is more property of the judgment obligor than is sufficient to satisfy the judgment
and lawful fees, he must sell only so much of the personal or real property as is sufficient to satisfy the
judgment and lawful fees.
Real property, stocks, shares, debts, credits, and other personal property, or any interest in either
real or personal property, may be levied upon in like manner and with like effect as under a writ of
attachment.
(c) Garnishment of debts and credits. – The officer may levy on debts due the judgment obligor and
other credits, including bank deposits, financial interests, royalties, commissions and other personal
property not capable of manual delivery in the possession or control of third parties. Levy shall be made
by serving notice upon the person owing such debts or having in his possession or control such credits
to which the judgment obligor is entitled. The garnishment shall cover only such amount as will satisfy
the judgment and all lawful fees.
The garnishee shall make a written report to the court within five (5) days from service of the
notice of garnishment stating whether or not the judgment obligor has sufficient funds or credits to
satisfy the amount of the judgment. If not, the report shall state how much funds or credits the garnishee
holds for the judgment obligor. The garnished amount in cash, or certified bank check issued in the name
of the judgment obligee, shall be delivered directly to the judgment obligee within ten (10) working days
from service of notice on said garnishee requiring such delivery, except the lawful fees which shall be
paid directly to the court.
In the event there are two or more garnishees holding deposits or credits sufficient to satisfy the
judgment, the judgment obligor, if available, shall have the right to indicate the garnishee or garnishees
who shall be required to deliver the amount due; otherwise, the choice shall be made by the judgment
obligee.
The executing sheriff shall observe the same procedure under paragraph (a) with respect to
delivery of payment to the judgment obligee. (8a, 15a)
Section 10. Execution of judgments for specific act. – (a) Conveyance, delivery of deeds, or other specific
acts; vesting title. – If a judgment directs a party to execute a conveyance of land or personal property, or
to deliver deeds or other documents, or to perform any other specific act in connection therewith, and the
party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may direct the act to be done at the cost of the
disobedient party by some other person appointed by the court and the act when so done shall have like
effect as if done by the party. If real or personal property is situated within the Philippines, the court in
lieu of directing a conveyance thereof may by an order divest the title of any party and vest it in others,
which shall have the force and effect of a conveyance executed in due form of law. (10a)
(b) Sale of real or personal property. – If the judgment be for the sale of real or personal property, to sell
such property, describing it, and apply the proceeds in conformity with the judgment. (8[c]a)

judgment for the delivery or restitution of real property is rendered and all persons claiming rights
under him to peaceably vacate the property within three (3) working days, and restore possession
thereof to the judgment obligee; otherwise, the officer shall oust all such persons therefrom with the
assistance, if necessary, of appropriate peace officers, and employing such means as may be reasonably
necessary to retake possession, and place the judgment obligee in possession of such property. Any
costs, damages, rents or profits awarded by the judgment shall be satisfied in the same manner as a
judgment for money. (13a)
(d) Removal of improvements on property subject of execution. – When the property subject of the
execution contains improvements constructed or planted by the judgment obligor or his agent, the officer
shall not destroy, demolish or remove said improvements except upon special order of the court, issued
upon motion of the judgment obligee after due hearing and after the former has failed to remove the
same within a reasonable time fixed by the court. (14a)
(e) Delivery of personal property. – In judgments for the delivery of personal property, the officer shall
take possession of the same and forthwith deliver it to the party entitled thereto and satisfy any judgment
for money as therein provided. (8a)
Section 11. Execution of special judgments. – When a judgment requires the performance of any act
other than those mentioned in the two preceding sections, a certified copy of the judgment shall be
attached to the writ of execution and shall be served by the officer upon the party against whom the same
is rendered, or upon any other person required thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and such party or
person may be punished for contempt if he disobeys such judgment. (9a)
Section 12. Effect of levy on execution as to third persons. – The levy on execution shall create a lien in
favor of the judgment obligee over the right, title and interest of the judgment obligor in such property
at the time of the levy, subject to liens and encumbrances then existing. (16a)
Section 13. Property exempt from execution. – Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the

(g) The professional libraries and equipment of judges, lawyers, physicians, pharmacists,
dentists, engineers, surveyors, clergymen, teachers, and other professionals, not exceeding
three hundred thousand pesos in value;
(h) One fishing boat and accessories not exceeding the total value of one hundred thousand pesos
owned by a fisherman and by the lawful use of which he earns his livelihood;
(i) So much of the salaries, wages, or earnings of the judgment obligor for his personal services
within the four months preceding the levy as are necessary for the support of his family;
(j) Lettered gravestones;

insurance;

(m) Properties specially exempted by law.
But no article or species of property mentioned in this section shall be exempt from execution
issued upon a judgment recovered for its price or upon a judgment of foreclosure of a mortgage
thereon. (12a)
Section 14. Return of writ of execution. – The writ of execution shall be returnable to the court issuing it
immediately after the judgment has been satisfied in part or in full. If the judgment cannot be satisfied in
full within thirty (30) days after his receipt of the writ, the officer shall report to the court and state the
reason therefor. Such writ shall continue in effect during the period within which the judgment may be
enforced by motion. The officer shall make a report to the court every thirty (30) days on the proceedings
taken thereon until the judgment is satisfied in full, or its effectivity expires. The returns or periodic
reports shall set forth the whole of the proceedings taken, and shall be filed with the court and copies
thereof promptly furnished the parties. (11a)
Section 15. Notice of sale of property on execution. – Before the sale of property on execution, notice
thereof must be given as follows:
(a) In case of perishable property, by posting written notice of the time and place of the sale in
three (3) public places, preferably in conspicuous areas of the municipal or city hall, post
office and public market in the municipality or city where the sale is to take place, for such
time as may be reasonable, considering the character and condition of the property;
(b) In case of other personal property, by posting a similar notice in the three (3) public places
above-mentioned for not less than five (5) days;
(c) In case of real property, by posting for twenty (20) days in the three (3) public places abovementioned
a similar notice particularly describing the property and stating where the property
is to be sold, and if the assessed value of the property exceeds fifty thousand (P50,000.00)
pesos, by publishing a copy of the notice once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in one
newspaper selected by raffle, whether in English, Filipino, or any major regional language
published, edited and circulated or, in the absence thereof, having general circulation in the
province or city;
(d) In all cases, written notice of the sale shall be given to the judgment obligor, at least three (3)
days before the sale, except as provided in paragraph (a) hereof where notice shall be given
at any time before the sale, in the same manner as personal service of pleadings and other
papers as provided by section 6 of Rule 13.
The notice shall specify the place, date and exact time of the sale which should not be earlier
than nine o’clock in the morning and not later than two o’clock in the afternoon. The place of
the sale may be agreed upon by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the sale of real
property or personal property not capable of manual delivery shall be held in the office of the
clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court or the Municipal Trial Court which issued the writ
or which was designated by the appellate court. In the case of personal property capable of
manual delivery, the sale shall be held in the place where the property is located. (18a)
Section 16. Proceedings where property claimed by third person. – If the property levied on is claimed
by any person other than the judgment obligor or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his
title thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, and serves the
same upon the officer making the levy and a copy thereof upon the judgment obligee, the officer shall
not be bound to keep the property, unless such judgment obligee, on demand of the officer, files a bond
approved by the court to indemnify the third-party claimant in a sum not less than the value of the
property levied on. In case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be determined by the court
issuing the writ of execution. No claim for damages for the taking or keeping of the property may be
enforced against the bond unless the action therefor is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days from
the date of the filing of the bond.
The officer shall not be liable for damages for the taking or keeping of the property, to any thirdparty
claimant if such bond is filed. Nothing herein contained shall prevent such claimant or any third
person from vindicating his claim to the property in a separate action, or prevent the judgment obligee
from claiming damages in the same or a separate action against a third-party claimant who filed a
frivolous or plainly spurious claim.
When the writ of execution is issued in favor of the Republic of the Philippines, or any officer
duly representing it, the filing of such bond shall not be required, and in case the sheriff or levying officer
is sued for damages as a result of the levy, he shall be represented by the Solicitor General and if held
liable therefor, the actual damages adjudged by the court shall be paid by the National Treasurer out of
such funds as may be appropriated for the purpose. (17a)
Section 17. Penalty for selling without notice, or removing or defacing notice. – An officer selling
without the notice prescribed by section 15 of this Rule shall be liable to pay punitive damages
in the amount of five thousand (P5,000.00) pesos to any person injured thereby, in addition to his
actual damages, both to be recovered by motion in the same action; and a person willfully removing
or defacing the notice posted, if done before the sale, or before the satisfaction of the judgment if it be
satisfied before the sale, shall be liable to pay five thousand (P5,000.00) pesos to any person injured by
reason thereof, in addition to his actual damages, to be recovered by motion in the same action. (19a)
Section 18. No sale if judgment and costs paid. – At any time before the sale of property on execution,
the judgment obligor may prevent the sale by paying the amount required by the execution and the costs
that have been incurred therein. (20a)
Section 19. How property sold on execution; who may direct manner and order of sale. – All sales of
property under execution must be made at public auction, to the highest bidder, to start at the exact time
fixed in the notice. After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more shall be sold
and any excess property or proceeds of the sale shall be promptly delivered to the judgment obligor or
his authorized representative, unless otherwise directed by the judgment or order of the court. When
the sale is of real property, consisting of several known lots, they must be sold separately; or, when a
portion of such real property is claimed by a third person, he may require it to be sold separately. When
the sale is of personal property capable of manual delivery, it must be sold within view of those attending
the same and in such parcels as are likely to bring the highest price. The judgment obligor, if present
at the sale, may direct the order in which property, real or personal, shall be sold, when such property
consists of several known lots or parcels which can be sold to advantage separately. Neither the officer
conducting the execution sale, nor his deputies, can become a purchaser, nor be interested directly or
indirectly in any purchase at such sale. (21a)
Section 20. Refusal of purchaser to pay. – If a purchaser refuses to pay the amount bid by him for
property struck off to him at a sale under execution, the officer may again sell the property to the highest
bidder and shall not be responsible for any loss occasioned thereby; but the court may order the refusing
purchaser to pay into the court the amount of such loss, with costs, and may punish him for contempt if
he disobeys the order. The amount of such payment shall be for the benefit of the person entitled to the
proceeds of the execution, unless the execution has been fully satisfied, in which event such proceeds
shall be for the benefit of the judgment obligor. The officer may thereafter reject any subsequent bid of
such purchaser who refuses to pay. (22a)
Section 21. Judgment obligee as purchaser. – When the purchaser is the judgment obligee, and no thirdparty
claim has been filed, he need not pay the amount of the bid if it does not exceed the amount of his
judgment. If it does, he shall pay only the excess. (23a)
Section 22. Adjournment of sale. – By written consent of the judgment obligor and obligee, or their duly
authorized representatives, the officer may adjourn the sale to any date and time agreed upon by them.
Without such agreement, he may adjourn the sale from day to day if it becomes necessary to do so for
lack of time to complete the sale on the day fixed in the notice or the day to which it was adjourned. (24a)
Section 23. Conveyance to purchaser of personal property capable of manual delivery. – When the
purchaser of any personal property, capable of manual delivery, pays the purchase price, the officer
making the sale must deliver the property to the purchaser and, if desired, execute and deliver to him
a certificate of sale. The sale conveys to the purchaser all the rights which the judgment obligor had in
such property as of the date of the levy on execution or preliminary attachment. (25a)
Section 24. Conveyance to purchaser of personal property not capable of manual delivery. – When the
purchaser of any personal property, not capable of manual delivery, pays the purchase price, the officer
making the sale must execute and deliver to the purchaser a certificate of sale. Such certificate conveys
to the purchaser all the rights which the judgment obligor had in such property as of the date of the levy
on execution or preliminary attachment. (26a)
Section 25. Conveyance of real property; certificate thereof given to purchaser and filed with registry
of deeds. – Upon a sale of real property, the officer must give to the purchaser a certificate of sale
containing:
(a) A particular description of the real property sold;
(b) The price paid for each distinct lot or parcel;
(c) The whole price paid by him;
(d) A statement that the right of redemption expires one (1) year from the date of the registration
of the certificate of sale.
Such certificate must be registered in the registry of deeds of the place where the property is
situated. (27a)
Section 26. Certificate of sale where property claimed by third person. – When a property sold by virtue
of a writ of execution has been claimed by a third person, the certificate of sale to be issued by the
sheriff pursuant to sections 23, 24 and 25 of this Rule shall make express mention of the existence of
such third-party claim. (28a)
Section 27. Who may redeem real property so sold. – Real property sold as provided in the last preceding
section, or any part thereof sold separately, may be redeemed in the manner hereinafter provided, by the
following persons:
(a) The judgment obligor, or his successor in interest in the whole or any part of the property;
(b) A creditor having a lien by virtue of an attachment, judgment or mortgage on the property
sold, or on some part thereof, subsequent to the lien under which the property was sold. Such
redeeming creditor is termed a redemptioner. (29a)
Section 28. Time and manner of, and amounts payable on, successive redemptions; notice to be given
and filed. – The judgment obligor, or redemptioner, may redeem the property from the purchaser, at
any time within one (1) year from the date of the registration of the certificate of sale, by paying the
purchaser the amount of his purchase, with one per centum per month interest thereon in addition, up to
the time of redemption, together with the amount of any assessments or taxes which the purchaser may
have paid thereon after purchase, and interest on such last named amount at the same rate; and if the
purchaser be also a creditor having a prior lien to that of the redemptioner, other than the judgment under
which such purchase was made, the amount of such other lien, with interest.
Property so redeemed may again be redeemed within sixty (60) days after the last redemption
upon payment of the sum paid on the last redemption, with two per centum thereon in addition, and the
amount of any assessments or taxes which the last redemptioner may have paid thereon after redemption
by him, with interest on such last-named amount, and in addition, the amount of any liens held by
said last redemptioner prior to his own, with interest. The property may be again, and as often as a
redemptioner is so disposed, redeemed from any previous redemptioner within sixty (60) days after the
last redemption, on paying the sum paid on the last previous redemption, with two per centum thereon
in addition, and the amounts of any assessments or taxes which the last previous redemptioner paid after
the redemption thereon, with interest thereon, and the amount of any liens held by the last redemptioner
prior to his own, with interest.
Written notice of any redemption must be given to the officer who made the sale and a duplicate
filed with the registry of deeds of the place, and if any assessments or taxes are paid by the redemptioner
or if he has or acquires any lien other than that upon which the redemption was made, notice thereof
must in like manner be given to the officer and filed with the registry of deeds; if such notice be not filed,
the property may be redeemed without paying such assessments, taxes, or liens. (30a)
Section 29. Effect of redemption by judgment obligor, and a certificate to be delivered and recorded
thereupon; to whom payments on redemption made. – If the judgment obligor redeems, he must make
the same payments as are required to effect a redemption by a redemptioner, whereupon, no further
redemption shall be allowed and he is restored to his estate. The person to whom the redemption payment
is made must execute and deliver to him a certificate of redemption acknowledged before a notary public
or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments of conveyances of real property. Such certificate
must be filed and recorded in the registry of deeds of the place in which the property is situated, and
the registrar of deeds must note the record thereof on the margin of the record of the certificate of
sale. The payments mentioned in this and the last preceding sections may be made to the purchaser or
redemptioner, or for him to the officer who made the sale. (31a)
Section 30. Proof required of redemptioner. – A redemptioner must produce to the officer, or person
from whom he seeks to redeem, and serve with his notice to the officer a copy of the judgment or final
order under which he claims the right to redeem, certified by the clerk of the court wherein the judgment
or final order is entered; or, if he redeems upon a mortgage or other lien, a memorandum of the record
thereof, certified by the registrar of deeds; or an original or certified copy of any assignment necessary
to establish his claim; and an affidavit executed by him or his agent, showing the amount then actually
due on the lien. (32a)
Section 31. Manner of using premises pending redemption; waste restrained. – Until the expiration of
the time allowed for redemption, the court may, as in other proper cases, restrain the commission of
waste on the property by injunction, on the application of the purchaser or the judgment obligee, with
or without notice; but it is not waste for a person in possession of the property at the time of the sale,
or entitled to possession afterwards, during the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use it in
the same manner in which it was previously used; or to use it in the ordinary course of husbandry; or to
make the necessary repairs to buildings thereon while he occupies the property. (33a)
Section 32. Rents, earnings and income of property pending redemption. – The purchaser or a redemptioner
shall not be entitled to receive the rents, earnings and income of the property sold on execution, or the
value of the use and occupation thereof when such property is in the possession of a tenant. All rents,
earnings and income derived from the property pending redemption shall belong to the judgment obligor
until the expiration of his period of redemption. (34a)
Section 33. Deed and possession to be given at expiration of redemption period; by whom executed or
given. – If no redemption be made within one (1) year from the date of the registration of the certificate
of sale, the purchaser is entitled to a conveyance and possession of the property; or, if so redeemed
whenever sixty (60) days have elapsed and no other redemption has been made, and notice thereof
given, and the time for redemption has expired, the last redemptioner is entitled to the conveyance and
possession; but in all cases the judgment obligor shall have the entire period of one (1) year from the date
of the registration of the sale to redeem the property. The deed shall be executed by the officer making
the sale or by his successor in office, and in the latter case shall have the same validity as though the
officer making the sale had continued in office and executed it.
Upon the expiration of the right of redemption, the purchaser or redemptioner shall be substituted
to and acquire all the rights, title, interest and claim of the judgment obligor to the property as of the time
of the levy. The possession of the property shall be given to the purchaser or last redemptioner by the
same officer unless a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment obligor. (35a)
Section 34. Recovery of price if sale not effective; revival of judgment. – If the purchaser of real property
sold on execution, or his successor in interest, fails to recover the possession thereof, or is evicted
therefrom, in consequence of irregularities in the proceedings concerning the sale, or because the
judgment has been reversed or set aside, or because the property sold was exempt from execution, or
because a third person has vindicated his claim to the property, he may on motion in the same action or
in a separate action recover from the judgment obligee the price paid, with interest, or so much thereof
as has not been delivered to the judgment obligor; or he may, on motion, have the original judgment
revived in his name for the whole price with interest, or so much thereof as has been delivered to the
judgment obligor. The judgment so revived shall have the same force and effect as an original judgment
would have as of the date of the revival and no more. (36a)
Section 35. Right to contribution or reimbursement. – When property liable to an execution against
several persons is sold thereon, and more than a due proportion of the judgment is satisfied out of the
proceeds of the sale of the property of one of them, or one of them pays, without a sale, more than his
proportion, he may compel a contribution from the others; and when a judgment is upon an obligation of
one of them, as security for another, and the surety pays the amount, or any part thereof, either by sale
of his property or before sale, he may compel repayment from the principal. (37a)
Section 36. Examination of judgment obligor when judgment unsatisfied. – When the return of a writ
of execution issued against property of a judgment obligor, or any one of several obligors in the same
judgment, shows that the judgment remains unsatisfied, in whole or in part, the judgment obligee, at
any time after such return is made, shall be entitled to an order from the court which rendered the said
judgment, requiring such judgment obligor to appear and be examined concerning his property and
income before such court or before a commissioner appointed by it, at a specified time and place; and
proceedings may thereupon be had for the application of the property and income of the judgment obligor
towards the satisfaction of the judgment. But no judgment obligor shall be so required to appear before a
court or commissioner outside the province or city in which such obligor resides or is found. (38a)
Section 37. Examination of obligor of judgment obligor. – When the return of a writ of execution against
the property of a judgment obligor shows that the judgment remains unsatisfied, in whole or in part,
and upon proof to the satisfaction of the court which issued the writ, that a person, corporation, or other
juridical entity has property of such judgment obligor or is indebted to him, the court may, by an order,
require such person, corporation, or other juridical entity, or any officer or member thereof, to appear
before the court or a commissioner appointed by it, at a time and place within the province or city
where such debtor resides or is found, and be examined concerning the same. The service of the order
shall bind all credits due the judgment obligor and all money and property of the judgment obligor in
the possession or in the control of such person, corporation, or juridical entity from the time of service;
and the court may also require notice of such proceedings to be given to any party to the action in such
manner as it may deem proper. (39a)
Section 38. Enforcement of attendance and conduct of examination. – A party or other person may be
compelled, by an order or subpoena, to attend before the court or commissioner to testify as provided
in the two preceding sections, and upon failure to obey such order or subpoena or to be sworn, or to
answer as a witness or to subscribe his deposition, may be punished for contempt as in other cases.
Examinations shall not be unduly prolonged, but the proceedings may be adjourned from time to time,
until they are completed. If the examination is before a commissioner, he must take it in writing and
certify it to the court. All examinations and answers before a court or commissioner must be under oath,
and when a corporation or other juridical entity answers, it must be on the oath of an authorized officer
or agent thereof. (40a)
Section 39. Obligor may pay execution against obligee. – After a writ of execution against property
has been issued, a person indebted to the judgment obligor may pay to the sheriff holding the writ of
execution the amount of his debt or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment, in the
manner prescribed in section 9 of this Rule, and the sheriff’s receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the
amount so paid or directed to be credited by the judgment obligee on the execution. (41a)
Section 40. Order for application of property and income to satisfaction of judgment. – The court may
order any property of the judgment obligor, or money due him, not exempt from execution, in the hands
of either himself or another person, or of a corporation or other juridical entity, to be applied to the
satisfaction of the judgment, subject to any prior rights over such property.
If, upon investigation of his current income and expenses, it appears that the earnings of the
judgment obligor for his personal services are more than necessary for the support of his family, the
court may order that he pay the judgment in fixed monthly installments, and upon his failure to pay any
such installment when due without good excuse, may punish him for indirect contempt. (42a)
Section 41. Appointment of receiver. – The court may appoint a receiver of the property of the judgment
obligor; and it may also forbid a transfer or other disposition of, or any interference with, the property
of the judgment obligor not exempt from execution. (43a)
Section 42. Sale of ascertainable interest of judgment obligor in real estate. – If it appears that the
judgment obligor has an interest in real estate in the place in which proceedings are had, as mortgagor or
mortgagee or otherwise, and his interest therein can be ascertained without controversy, the receiver may
be ordered to sell and convey such real estate or the interest of the obligor therein; and such sale shall
be conducted in all respects in the same manner as is provided for the sale of real estate upon execution,
and the proceedings thereon shall be approved by the court before the execution of the deed. (44a)
Section 43. Proceedings when indebtedness denied or another person claims the property. – If it appears
that a person or corporation, alleged to have property of the judgment obligor or to be indebted to him,
claims an interest in the property adverse to him or denies the debt, the court may authorize, by an order
made to that effect, the judgment obligee to institute an action against such person or corporation for
the recovery of such interest or debt, forbid a transfer or other disposition of such interest or debt within
one hundred twenty (120) days from notice of the order, and may punish disobedience of such order as
for contempt. Such order may be modified or vacated at any time by the court which issued it, or by the
court in which the action is brought, upon such terms as may be just. (45a)
Section 44. Entry of satisfaction of judgment by clerk of court. – Satisfaction of a judgment shall be
entered by the clerk of court in the court docket, and in the execution book, upon the return of a writ
of execution showing the full satisfaction of the judgment, or upon the filing of an admission to the
satisfaction of the judgment executed and acknowledged in the same manner as a conveyance of real
property by the judgment obligee or by his counsel unless a revocation of his authority is filed, or upon
the endorsement of such admission by the judgment obligee or his counsel on the face of the record of
the judgment. (46a)
Section 45. Entry of satisfaction with or without admission. – Whenever a judgment is satisfied in fact,
or otherwise than upon an execution, on demand of the judgment obligor, the judgment obligee or his
counsel must execute and acknowledge, or indorse, an admission of the satisfaction as provided in the
last preceding section, and after notice and upon motion the court may order either the judgment obligee
or his counsel to do so, or may order the entry of satisfaction to be made without such admission. (47a)
Section 46. When principal bound by judgment against surety. – When a judgment is rendered against
a party who stands as surety for another, the latter is also bound from the time that he has notice of the
action or proceeding, and an opportunity at the surety’s request to join in the defense. (48a)
Section 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. – The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a
court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:
(a) In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a
will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal,
political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the
judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration, or
the condition, status or relationship of the person; however, the probate of a will or granting
of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or
intestate;
(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or
as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the
parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action
or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same
capacity; and
(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is
deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its
face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or
necessary thereto. (49a)
Section 48. Effect of foreign judgments or final orders. – The effect of a judgment or final order of a
tribunal of a foreign country, having jurisdiction to render the judgment or final order is as follows:
(a) In case of a judgment or final order upon a specific thing, the judgment or final order is
conclusive upon the title to the thing; and
(b) In case of a judgment or final order against a person, the judgment or final order is presumptive
evidence of a right as between the parties and their successors in interest by a subsequent
title.
In either case, the judgment or final order may be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction,
want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact. (50a)

clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court to elevate the original record of the case including the oral and
documentary evidence within fifteen (15) days from notice. (n)

Section 8. Action on the petition. – The Court of Appeals may require the respondent to file a comment

the award, judgment, final order or resolution sought to be reviewed, it may give due course to the
petition; otherwise, it shall dismiss the same. The findings of fact of the court or agency concerned, when
supported by substantial evidence, shall be binding on the Court of Appeals. (n)

will be granted only when there are special and important reasons therefor. The following, while neither

whether the petition should be dismissed or denied pursuant to section 5 of this Rule, or where the
petition is given due course under section 8 hereof, the Supreme Court may require or allow the filing
