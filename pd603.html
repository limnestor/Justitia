            <div style="text-align: justify;">I, Ferdinand E. Marcos, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution, hereby order and decree the following:</div>
            <p />
            <div style="text-align: justify;">
                <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Title</strong><strong> I.</strong><strong> General Principles</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Article 1.</strong> Declaration of Policy. &#8211; The Child is one of the most important assets of the nation. Every effort should be exerted to promote his welfare and enhance his opportunities for a useful and happy life.</p>
                <p>The child is not a mere creature of the State. Hence, his individual traits and aptitudes should be cultivated to the utmost insofar as they do not conflict with the general welfare.</p>
                <p>The molding of the character of the child starts at the home. Consequently, every member of the family should strive to make the home a wholesome and harmonious place as its atmosphere and conditions will greatly influence the child&#8217;s development.</p>
                <p>Attachment to the home and strong family ties should be encouraged but not to the extent of making the home isolated and exclusive and unconcerned with the interests of the community and the country.</p>
                <p>The natural right and duty of parents in the rearing of the child for civic efficiency should receive the aid and support of the government.</p>
                <p>Other institutions, like the school, the church, the guild, and the community in general, should assist the home and the State in the endeavor to prepare the child for the responsibilities of adulthood.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 2.</strong> Title and Scope of Code. &#8211; The Code shall be known as the &#8220;Child and Youth Welfare Code&#8221;.

                <p>(3) Every child has the right to a well-rounded development of his personality to the end that he may become a happy, useful and active member of society.</p>
                <p>The gifted child shall be given opportunity and encouragement to develop his special talents.</p>
                <p>The emotionally disturbed or socially maladjusted child shall be treated with sympathy and understanding, and shall be entitled to treatment and competent care.</p>
                <p>The physically or mentally handicapped child shall be given the treatment, education and care required by his particular condition.</p>
                <p>(4) Every child has the right to a balanced diet, adequate clothing, sufficient shelter, proper medical attention, and all the basic physical requirements of a healthy and vigorous life.</p>
                <p>(5) Every child has the right to be brought up in an atmosphere of morality and rectitude for the enrichment and the strengthening of his character.</p>
                <p>(6) Every child has the right to an education commensurate with his abilities and to the development of his skills for the improvement of his capacity for service to himself and to his fellowmen.</p>
                <p>(7) Every child has the right to full opportunities for safe and wholesome recreation and activities, individual as well as social, for the wholesome use of his leisure hours.</p>

                <p>(6) Participate actively in civic affairs and in the promotion of the general welfare, always bearing in mind that it is the youth who will eventually be called upon to discharge the responsibility of leadership in shaping the nation&#8217;s future; and</p>

If it is found that the cause for the commitment of the child no longer exists and that the petitioner is already able to take proper care and custody of the child, the court, after taking into consideration the best interests and the welfare of the child, shall render judgment restoring parental authority to the petitioner.</p>

                <p><strong>Chapter 2.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Mentally Retarded, Physically Handicapped, Emotionally Disturbed And Mentally Ill Children</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Art. 168.</strong> Mentally Retarded Children. &#8211; Mentally retarded children are (1) socially incompetent, that is, socially inadequate and occupationally incompetent and unable to manage their own affairs; (2) mentally subnormal; (3) retarded intellectually from birth or early age; (4) retarded at maturity; (5) mentally deficient as a result of constitutional origin, through hereditary or disease, and (6) essentially incurable.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 169.</strong> Classification of Mental Retardation. &#8211; Mental Retardation is divided into four classifications:</p>
                <p>(1) Custodial Group. The members of this classification are severely or profoundly retarded, hence, the least capable group. This includes those with I.Q.s to 25.</p>
                <p>(2) Trainable Group. The members of this group consist of those with I.Q.s from about 25 to about 50; one who belongs to this group shows a mental level and rate of development which is 1/4 to 1/2 that of the average child, is unable to acquire higher academic skills, but can usually acquire the basic skills for living to a reasonable degree. He can likewise attain a primary grade level of education if he receives effective instruction.</p>
                <p>(3) Educable Group. This group&#8217;s I.Q. ranges from about 50 to about 75, and the intellectual development is approximately 1/2 to 3/4 of that expected of a normal child of the same chronological age. The degree of success or accomplishment that they will reach in life depends very much on the quality and type of education they receive, as well as on the treatment at home and in the community. Many of the educable retardates may reach 5th or 6th grade educational level and can develop occupational skills which may result in partial or complete economic independence in adulthood.</p>
                <p>(4) Borderline or Low Normal Group. This is the highest group of mentally retarded, with I.Q.s from about 75 to about 89. The members of this classification are only slightly retarded and they can usually get by in regular classes if they receive some extra help, guidance and consideration. They have to spend much more time with their studies than do most children in order to pass. Those who cannot make it are usually handicapped by one or more other conditions aside from that of intelligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 170.</strong> Physically Handicapped Children. &#8211; Physically handicapped children are those who are crippled, deaf-mute, blind, or otherwise defective which restricts their means of action or communication with others.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 171.</strong> Emotionally Disturbed Children. &#8211; Emotionally disturbed children are those who, although not afflicted with insanity or mental defect, are unable to maintain normal social relations with others and the community in general due to emotional problems or complexes.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 172.</strong> Mentally Ill Children. &#8211; Mentally ill children are those with any behavioral disorder, whether functional or organic, which is of such a degree of severity as to require professional help or hospitalization.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 173.</strong> Admission of Disabled Children. &#8211; The Department of Social Welfare, upon the application of the parents or guardians and the recommendation of any reputable diagnostic center or clinic, shall refer and/or admit disabled children to any public or private institution providing the proper care, training and rehabilitation.</p>
                <p>&#8220;Disabled children&#8221; as used in this Chapter shall include mentally retarded, physically handicapped, emotionally disturbed, and severe mentally ill children.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 174.</strong> Training and Opportunities for Disabled Children. &#8211; Specialized educational services shall be expanded and improved to provide appropriate opportunities for disabled children. Vocational rehabilitation and manpower conservation agencies shall train disabled children for specialized types of jobs, services and business which could be learned only by them and shall help provide opportunities for their future occupational placement: That the agencies and organizations engaged in programs and services for the disabled need not be limited to minors. Persons of legal age may be admitted whenever facilities are available for them.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 175.</strong> Planning of Programs and Services. &#8211; Selected pilot demonstration projects needed by the disabled children shall be developed and shall be the basis for planning expanded programs and services throughout the nation. There shall be established area centers designed to bring together an aggregate of services to serve all ages of the disabled within a specified geographical area.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 176.</strong> Donations. &#8211; Donations to agencies and organizations engaged in programs and services for disabled children shall be deductible in accordance with the provision of Presidential Decree No. 507.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 177.</strong> Petition for Commitment. &#8211; Where a child appears to be mentally retarded, physically handicapped, emotionally disturbed, or mentally ill, and needs institutional care but his parents or guardians are opposed thereto, the Department of Social Welfare, or any duly licensed child placement agency or individual shall have the authority to file a petition for commitment of the said child to any reputable institution providing care, training and rehabilitation for disabled children.</p>
                <p>The parents or guardian of the child may file a similar petition in case no immediate placement can be arranged for the disabled child when the welfare and interest of the child is at stake.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 178.</strong> Venue. &#8211; The petition for commitment of a disabled child shall be filed with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, if any, or with the Court of First Instance of the province or City Court where the parent or guardian resides or where the child is found.</p>

                <p>(3) The name of the parents and their residence, if known or if the child has no parents or parent living, the names and residence of the guardian, if any; and</p>
                <p>(4) The name of the institution where the child is to be committed.</p>
                <p>The petition shall be verified and shall be sufficient if based upon the information and belief of the petitioner.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 180.</strong> Order of Hearing. &#8211; If the petition filed is sufficient in form and substance, the court, by an order reciting the purpose of the petition, shall fix the date for the hearing thereof, and a copy of such order shall be served on the child alleged to be mentally retarded, or physically handicapped, or emotionally disturbed, or mentally ill, and on the person having charge of him or any of his relatives residing in the province or city as the judge may deem proper. The court shall furthermore order the sheriff to produce, if possible, the alleged disabled child on the date of the hearing.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 181</strong>. Hearing and Judgment. &#8211; Upon satisfactory proof that the institutional care of the child is for him or the public welfare and that his parents, or guardian or relatives are unable for any reason to take proper care of him, the Court shall order his commitment to the proper institution for disabled children.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 182.</strong> Disposition of Property or Money. &#8211; The Court, in its order of commitment, shall make proper provisions for the custody of property or money belonging to the committed child.</p>

                <p><strong>Art. 184.</strong> Expenses. &#8211; The expense of maintaining a disabled child in the institution to which he has been committed shall be borne primarily by the parents or guardian and secondarily, by such disabled child, if he has property of his own.</p>
                <p>In all cases where the expenses for the maintenance of the disabled child cannot be paid in accordance with the next preceding paragraph, the same, or such part thereof as may remain unpaid, shall be borne by the Department of Social Welfare.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 185. </strong>Children With Cerebral Palsy. &#8211; Children afflicted with cerebral palsy shall be committed to the institution which under the circumstances of the particular child concerned is best equipped to treat and care for him.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 186.</strong> Discharge of Child Judicially Committed. &#8211; The Court shall order the discharge of any child judicially committed to an institution for disabled children if it is certified by the Department of Social Welfare that:</p>

                <p><strong>Art. 197.</strong> Return of the Youth Offender to Court. &#8211; Whenever the youthful offender has been found incorrigible or has willfully failed to comply with the conditions of his rehabilitation programs, or should his continued stay in the training institution be inadvisable, he shall be returned to the committing court for the pronouncement of judgment.</p>
                <p>When the youthful offender has reached the age of twenty-one while in commitment, the court shall determine whether to dismiss the case in accordance with the next preceding article or to pronounce the judgment of conviction.</p>
                <p>In any case covered by this article, the youthful offender shall be credited in the service of his sentence with the full time spent in actual commitment and detention effected under the provisions of this Chapter.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 198.</strong> Effect of Release of Child Based on Good Conduct. &#8211; The final release of a child pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter shall not obliterate his civil liability for damages. Such release shall be without prejudice to the right for a writ of execution for the recovery of civil damages.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 199.</strong> Living Quarters for Youthful Offenders Sentence. &#8211; When a judgment of conviction is pronounced in accordance with the provisions of Article 197, and at the time of said pronouncement the youthful offender is still under twenty-one, he shall be committed to the proper penal institution to serve the remaining period of his sentence: Provided, That penal institutions shall provide youthful offenders with separate quarters and, as far as practicable, group them according to appropriate age levels or other criteria as will insure their speedy rehabilitation: Provided, further, That the Bureau of Prisons shall maintain agricultural and forestry camps where youthful offenders may serve their sentence in lieu of confinement in regular penitentiaries.</p>

The youthful offender concerned shall not be held under any provision of law, to be guilty of perjury or of concealment or misrepresentation by reason of his failure to acknowledge the case or recite any fact related thereto in response to any inquiry made of him for any purpose.</p>

                <p><strong>Art. 201.</strong> Civil Liability of Youthful Offenders. &#8211; The civil liability for acts committed by a youthful offender shall devolve upon the offender&#8217;s father and, in case of his death or incapacity, upon the mother, or in case of her death or incapacity, upon the guardian.
