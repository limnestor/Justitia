            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">I, Ferdinand E. Marcos, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution, hereby order and decree the following:</div>
            <p />
            <div style="text-align: justify;">
                <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Title</strong><strong> I.</strong><strong> General Principles</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Article 1.</strong> Declaration of Policy. &#8211; The Child is one of the most important assets of the nation. Every effort should be exerted to promote his welfare and enhance his opportunities for a useful and happy life.</p>
                <p>The child is not a mere creature of the State. Hence, his individual traits and aptitudes should be cultivated to the utmost insofar as they do not conflict with the general welfare.</p>
                <p>The molding of the character of the child starts at the home. Consequently, every member of the family should strive to make the home a wholesome and harmonious place as its atmosphere and conditions will greatly influence the child&#8217;s development.</p>
                <p>Attachment to the home and strong family ties should be encouraged but not to the extent of making the home isolated and exclusive and unconcerned with the interests of the community and the country.</p>
                <p>The natural right and duty of parents in the rearing of the child for civic efficiency should receive the aid and support of the government.</p>
                <p>Other institutions, like the school, the church, the guild, and the community in general, should assist the home and the State in the endeavor to prepare the child for the responsibilities of adulthood.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 2.</strong> Title and Scope of Code. &#8211; The Code shall be known as the &#8220;Child and Youth Welfare Code&#8221;.

                <p>(3) Every child has the right to a well-rounded development of his personality to the end that he may become a happy, useful and active member of society.</p>

                <p>The physically or mentally handicapped child shall be given the treatment, education and care required by his particular condition.</p>
                <p>(4) Every child has the right to a balanced diet, adequate clothing, sufficient shelter, proper medical attention, and all the basic physical requirements of a healthy and vigorous life.</p>

                <p>(6) Every child has the right to an education commensurate with his abilities and to the development of his skills for the improvement of his capacity for service to himself and to his fellowmen.</p>
                <p>(7) Every child has the right to full opportunities for safe and wholesome recreation and activities, individual as well as social, for the wholesome use of his leisure hours.</p>

                <p>(6) Participate actively in civic affairs and in the promotion of the general welfare, always bearing in mind that it is the youth who will eventually be called upon to discharge the responsibility of leadership in shaping the nation&#8217;s future; and</p>

                <p>(1) A dependent child is one who is without a parent, guardian or custodian; or one whose parents, guardian or other custodian for good cause desires to be relieved of his care and custody; and is dependent upon the public for support.</p>
                <p>(2) An abandoned child is one who has no proper parental care or guardianship, or whose parents or guardians have deserted him for a period of at least six continuous months.</p>
                <p>(3) A neglected child is one whose basic needs have been deliberately unattended or inadequately attended. Neglect may occur in two ways:</p>
                <p>a) There is a physical neglect when the child is malnourished, ill clad and without proper shelter.</p>
                <p>A child is unattended when left by himself without provisions for his needs and/or without proper supervision.</p>
                <p>b) Emotional neglect exists: when children are maltreated, raped or seduced; when children are exploited, overworked or made to work under conditions not conducive to good health; or are made to beg in the streets or public places, or when children are in moral danger, or exposed to gambling, prostitution and other vices.</p>
                <p>(4) Commitment or surrender of a child is the legal act of entrusting a child to the care of the Department of Social Welfare or any duly licensed child placement agency or individual.</p>
                <p>Commitment may be done in the following manner:</p>
                <p>a) Involuntary commitment, in case of a dependent child, or through the termination of parental or guardianship rights by reason of abandonment, substantial and continuous or repeated neglect and/or parental incompetence to discharge parental responsibilities, and in the manner, form and procedure hereinafter prescribed.</p>
                <p>b) Voluntary commitment, through the relinquishment of parental or guardianship rights in the manner and form hereinafter prescribed.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 142.</strong> Petition for Involuntary Commitment of a Child: Venue. &#8211; The Department of Social Welfare Secretary or his authorized representative or any duly licensed child placement agency having knowledge of a child who appears to be dependent, abandoned or neglected, may file a verified petition for involuntary commitment of said child to the care of any duly licensed child placement agency or individual.</p>
                <p>The petition shall be filed with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, if any, or with the Court of First Instance of the province or City Court in which the parents or guardian resides or the child is found.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 143.</strong> Contents of Petition: Verification. &#8211; The petition for commitment must state so far as known to the petitioner:</p>

                <p>(2) The names of the parent or parents, if known, and their residence. If the child has no parent or parents living, then the name and residence of the guardian, if any; and</p>
                <p>(3) The name of the duly licensed child placement agency or individual to whose care the commitment of the child is sought.</p>
                <p>The petition shall be verified and shall be sufficient if based upon the information and belief of the petitioner.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 144.</strong> Court to Set Time for Hearing: Summons. &#8211; When a petition or commitment is filed, the court shall fix a date for the hearing thereof. If it appears from the petition that one or both parents of the child, or the guardian, resides in province or city, the clerk of court shall immediately issue summons, together with a copy of the petition, which shall be served on such parent or guardian not less than two days before the time fixed for the hearing. Such summons shall require them to appear before the court on the date mentioned.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 145.</strong> When Summons shall Not be Issued. &#8211; The summons provided for in the next preceding article shall not be issued and the court shall thereupon proceed with the hearing of the case if it appears from the petition that both parents of the child are dead or that neither parent can be found in the province or city and that the child has no guardian residing therein.</p>

In such hearing, the court shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence.</p>
                <p>Failure to provide for the child&#8217;s support for a period of six months shall be presumptive evidence of the intent to abandon.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 149.</strong> Commitment of Child. &#8211; If, after the hearing, the child is found to be dependent, abandoned, or neglected, an order shall be entered committing him to the care and custody of the Department of Social Welfare or any duly licensed child placement agency or individual.</p>

                <p>When it appears to the court that it is no longer for the best interests of such child to remain with his parents or guardian, it may commit the child in accordance with the next preceding article.</p>

                <p><strong>Art. 153.</strong> Change of Custody. &#8211; The Department of Social Welfare shall have the authority to change the custody of a child committed to any duly licensed child placement agency or individual if it appears that such change is for the best interests of the child. However, when conflicting interests arise among child placement agencies the court shall order the change of commitment of the child.</p>

In case of the death or legal incapacity of either parent or abandonment of the child for a period of at least one year, the other parent alone shall have the authority to make the commitment. The Department of Social Welfare, or any proper and duly licensed child placement agency or individual shall have the authority to receive, train, educate, care for or arrange appropriate placement of such child.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 156.</strong> Legal Custody. &#8211; When any child shall have been committed in accordance with the preceding article and such child shall have been accepted by the Department of Social Welfare or any duly licensed child placement agency or individual, the rights of his natural parents, guardian, or other custodian to exercise parental authority over him shall cease.</p>

                <p>The temporary custody of the child shall be discontinued if it appears that he is not being given proper care, or at his own request, or at the instance of the agency or person receiving him.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 160.</strong> Prohibited Acts. &#8211; It shall be unlawful for any child to leave the person or institution to which he has been judicially or voluntarily committed or the person under whose custody he has been placed in accordance with the next preceding article, or for any person to induce him to leave such person or institution, except in case of grave physical or moral danger, actual or imminent, to the child.</p>
                <p>Any violation of this article shall be punishable by an imprisonment of not more than one year or by a fine of not more than two thousand pesos, or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court: Provided, That if the violation is committed by a foreigner, he shall also be subject to deportation.</p>
                <p>If the violation is committed by a parent or legal guardian of the child, such fact shall aggravate or mitigate the offense as circumstances shall warrant.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 161.</strong> Duty to Report Abandonment. &#8211; When the parents or persons entitled to act as guardian of a child are dead or, if living, have abandoned him, for no valid reason, for at least six months in a duly licensed child placement agency or hospital, or left him with any other person for the same period without providing for his care and support, such fact shall be reported immediately to the Department of Social Welfare.

The petition shall be verified and shall state that the petitioner is now able to take proper care and custody of said child.</p>
                <p>Upon receiving the petition, the court shall fix the time for hearing the questions raised thereby and cause reasonable notice thereof to be sent to the petitioner and to the person, agency or institution to which the child has been committed. At the trial, any person may be allowed, at the discretion of the court, to contest the right to the relief demanded, and witnesses may be called and examined by the parties or by the court motu proprio. If it is found that the cause for the commitment of the child no longer exists and that the petitioner is already able to take proper care and custody of the child, the court, after taking into consideration the best interests and the welfare of the child, shall render judgment restoring parental authority to the petitioner.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 164.</strong> Restoration After Voluntary Commitment.

                <p>The license of the agency or individual found guilty of such neglect may be suspended or revoked, as the court may deem proper, in the same proceeding.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 166.</strong> Report of Maltreated or Abused Child. &#8211; All hospitals, clinics and other institutions as well as private physicians providing treatment shall, within forty-eight hours from knowledge of the case, report in writing to the city or provincial fiscal or to the Local Council for the Protection of Children or to the nearest unit of the Department of Social Welfare, any case of a maltreated or abused child, or exploitation of an employed child contrary to the provisions of labor laws.

                <p><strong>Chapter 2.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Mentally Retarded, Physically Handicapped, Emotionally Disturbed And Mentally Ill Children</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Art. 168.</strong> Mentally Retarded Children. &#8211; Mentally retarded children are (1) socially incompetent, that is, socially inadequate and occupationally incompetent and unable to manage their own affairs; (2) mentally subnormal; (3) retarded intellectually from birth or early age; (4) retarded at maturity; (5) mentally deficient as a result of constitutional origin, through hereditary or disease, and (6) essentially incurable.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 169.</strong> Classification of Mental Retardation. &#8211; Mental Retardation is divided into four classifications:</p>
                <p>(1) Custodial Group. The members of this classification are severely or profoundly retarded, hence, the least capable group. This includes those with I.Q.s to 25.</p>
                <p>(2) Trainable Group. The members of this group consist of those with I.Q.s from about 25 to about 50; one who belongs to this group shows a mental level and rate of development which is 1/4 to 1/2 that of the average child, is unable to acquire higher academic skills, but can usually acquire the basic skills for living to a reasonable degree. He can likewise attain a primary grade level of education if he receives effective instruction.</p>
                <p>(3) Educable Group. This group&#8217;s I.Q. ranges from about 50 to about 75, and the intellectual development is approximately 1/2 to 3/4 of that expected of a normal child of the same chronological age. The degree of success or accomplishment that they will reach in life depends very much on the quality and type of education they receive, as well as on the treatment at home and in the community. Many of the educable retardates may reach 5th or 6th grade educational level and can develop occupational skills which may result in partial or complete economic independence in adulthood.</p>
                <p>(4) Borderline or Low Normal Group. This is the highest group of mentally retarded, with I.Q.s from about 75 to about 89. The members of this classification are only slightly retarded and they can usually get by in regular classes if they receive some extra help, guidance and consideration. They have to spend much more time with their studies than do most children in order to pass. Those who cannot make it are usually handicapped by one or more other conditions aside from that of intelligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 170.</strong> Physically Handicapped Children. &#8211; Physically handicapped children are those who are crippled, deaf-mute, blind, or otherwise defective which restricts their means of action or communication with others.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 171.</strong> Emotionally Disturbed Children. &#8211; Emotionally disturbed children are those who, although not afflicted with insanity or mental defect, are unable to maintain normal social relations with others and the community in general due to emotional problems or complexes.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 172.</strong> Mentally Ill Children. &#8211; Mentally ill children are those with any behavioral disorder, whether functional or organic, which is of such a degree of severity as to require professional help or hospitalization.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 173.</strong> Admission of Disabled Children. &#8211; The Department of Social Welfare, upon the application of the parents or guardians and the recommendation of any reputable diagnostic center or clinic, shall refer and/or admit disabled children to any public or private institution providing the proper care, training and rehabilitation.</p>
                <p>&#8220;Disabled children&#8221; as used in this Chapter shall include mentally retarded, physically handicapped, emotionally disturbed, and severe mentally ill children.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 174.</strong> Training and Opportunities for Disabled Children. &#8211; Specialized educational services shall be expanded and improved to provide appropriate opportunities for disabled children. Vocational rehabilitation and manpower conservation agencies shall train disabled children for specialized types of jobs, services and business which could be learned only by them and shall help provide opportunities for their future occupational placement: That the agencies and organizations engaged in programs and services for the disabled need not be limited to minors. Persons of legal age may be admitted whenever facilities are available for them.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 175.</strong> Planning of Programs and Services. &#8211; Selected pilot demonstration projects needed by the disabled children shall be developed and shall be the basis for planning expanded programs and services throughout the nation. There shall be established area centers designed to bring together an aggregate of services to serve all ages of the disabled within a specified geographical area.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 176.</strong> Donations. &#8211; Donations to agencies and organizations engaged in programs and services for disabled children shall be deductible in accordance with the provision of Presidential Decree No. 507.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 177.</strong> Petition for Commitment. &#8211; Where a child appears to be mentally retarded, physically handicapped, emotionally disturbed, or mentally ill, and needs institutional care but his parents or guardians are opposed thereto, the Department of Social Welfare, or any duly licensed child placement agency or individual shall have the authority to file a petition for commitment of the said child to any reputable institution providing care, training and rehabilitation for disabled children.</p>
                <p>The parents or guardian of the child may file a similar petition in case no immediate placement can be arranged for the disabled child when the welfare and interest of the child is at stake.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 178.</strong> Venue. &#8211; The petition for commitment of a disabled child shall be filed with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, if any, or with the Court of First Instance of the province or City Court where the parent or guardian resides or where the child is found.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 179.</strong> Contents of Petition. &#8211; The petition for commitment must state so far as known to the petitioner:</p>

                <p>(2) The fact that the parents or guardians or any duly licensed disabled child placement agency, as the case may be, has opposed the commitment of such child;</p>
                <p>(3) The name of the parents and their residence, if known or if the child has no parents or parent living, the names and residence of the guardian, if any; and</p>
                <p>(4) The name of the institution where the child is to be committed.</p>
                <p>The petition shall be verified and shall be sufficient if based upon the information and belief of the petitioner.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 180.</strong> Order of Hearing. &#8211; If the petition filed is sufficient in form and substance, the court, by an order reciting the purpose of the petition, shall fix the date for the hearing thereof, and a copy of such order shall be served on the child alleged to be mentally retarded, or physically handicapped, or emotionally disturbed, or mentally ill, and on the person having charge of him or any of his relatives residing in the province or city as the judge may deem proper. The court shall furthermore order the sheriff to produce, if possible, the alleged disabled child on the date of the hearing.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 181</strong>. Hearing and Judgment. &#8211; Upon satisfactory proof that the institutional care of the child is for him or the public welfare and that his parents, or guardian or relatives are unable for any reason to take proper care of him, the Court shall order his commitment to the proper institution for disabled children.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 182.</strong> Disposition of Property or Money. &#8211; The Court, in its order of commitment, shall make proper provisions for the custody of property or money belonging to the committed child.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 183.</strong> Findings and Other Data. &#8211; The Court shall furnish the institution to which the child has been committed with a copy of its judgment, together with all the social and other data pertinent to the case.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 184.</strong> Expenses. &#8211; The expense of maintaining a disabled child in the institution to which he has been committed shall be borne primarily by the parents or guardian and secondarily, by such disabled child, if he has property of his own.</p>
                <p>In all cases where the expenses for the maintenance of the disabled child cannot be paid in accordance with the next preceding paragraph, the same, or such part thereof as may remain unpaid, shall be borne by the Department of Social Welfare.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 185. </strong>Children With Cerebral Palsy. &#8211; Children afflicted with cerebral palsy shall be committed to the institution which under the circumstances of the particular child concerned is best equipped to treat and care for him.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 186.</strong> Discharge of Child Judicially Committed. &#8211; The Court shall order the discharge of any child judicially committed to an institution for disabled children if it is certified by the Department of Social Welfare that:</p>
                <p>(1) He has been certified by the duly licensed disabled child placement agency to be no longer a hazard to himself or to the community;</p>
                <p>(2) He has been sufficiently rehabilitated from his physical handicap or, if of work age, is already fit to engage in a gainful occupation; or</p>

                <p>When the youthful offender has reached the age of twenty-one while in commitment, the court shall determine whether to dismiss the case in accordance with the next preceding article or to pronounce the judgment of conviction.</p>

                <p><strong>Art. 198.</strong> Effect of Release of Child Based on Good Conduct. &#8211; The final release of a child pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter shall not obliterate his civil liability for damages. Such release shall be without prejudice to the right for a writ of execution for the recovery of civil damages.</p>
                <p><strong>Art. 199.</strong> Living Quarters for Youthful Offenders Sentence. &#8211; When a judgment of conviction is pronounced in accordance with the provisions of Article 197, and at the time of said pronouncement the youthful offender is still under twenty-one, he shall be committed to the proper penal institution to serve the remaining period of his sentence: Provided, That penal institutions shall provide youthful offenders with separate quarters and, as far as practicable, group them according to appropriate age levels or other criteria as will insure their speedy rehabilitation: Provided, further, That the Bureau of Prisons shall maintain agricultural and forestry camps where youthful offenders may serve their sentence in lieu of confinement in regular penitentiaries.</p>
