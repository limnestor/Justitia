            <p align="center">AN ACT PROVIDING FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991</p>
            <p align="center">BOOK I</p>
            <p align="center">General Provisions</p>
            <p align="center">TITLE I</p>
            <p align="center">Basic Principles</p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER I</p>
            <p align="center">The Code: Policy and Application</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 1. Title. &#8211; This Act shall be known and cited as the &#8220;Local Government Code of 1991&#8221;.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 2. Declaration of Policy. &#8211; (a) It is hereby declared the policy of the State that the territorial and political subdivisions of the State shall enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals. Toward this end, the State shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization whereby local government units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources. The process of decentralization shall proceed from the National Government to the local government units.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) It is also the policy of the State to ensure the accountability of local government units through the institution of effective mechanisms of recall, initiative and referendum.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) It is likewise the policy of the State to require all national agencies and offices to conduct periodic consultations with appropriate local government units, nongovernmental and people&#8217;s organizations, and other concerned sectors of the community before any project or program is implemented in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 3. Operative Principles of Decentralization. &#8211; The formulation and implementation of policies and measures on local autonomy shall be guided by the following operative principles:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) There shall be an effective allocation among the different local government units of their respective powers, functions, responsibilities, and resources;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) There shall be established in every local government unit an accountable, efficient, and dynamic organizational structure and operating mechanism that will meet the priority needs and service requirements of its communities;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) Subject to civil service law, rules and regulations, local officials and employees paid wholly or mainly from local funds shall be appointed or removed, according to merit and fitness, by the appropriate appointing authority;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) The vesting of duty, responsibility, and accountability in local government units shall be accompanied with provision for reasonably adequate resources to discharge their powers and effectively carry out their functions; hence, they shall have the power to create and broaden their own sources of revenue and the right to a just share in national taxes and an equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of the national wealth within their respective areas;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(e) Provinces with respect to component cities and municipalities, and cities and municipalities with respect to component barangays, shall ensure that the acts of their component units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(f) Local government units may group themselves, consolidate or coordinate their efforts, services, and resources for purposes commonly beneficial to them;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(g) The capabilities of local government units, especially the municipalities and barangays, shall be enhanced by providing them with opportunities to participate actively in the implementation of national programs and projects;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(h) There shall be a continuing mechanism to enhance local autonomy not only by legislative enabling acts but also by administrative and organizational reforms;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(i) Local government units shall share with the national government the responsibility in the management and maintenance of ecological balance within their territorial jurisdiction, subject to the provisions of this Code and national policies;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(j) Effective mechanisms for ensuring the accountability of local government units to their respective constituents shall be strengthened in order to upgrade continually the quality of local leadership;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(k) The realization of local autonomy shall be facilitated through improved coordination of national government policies and programs and extension of adequate technical and material assistance to less developed and deserving local government units;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(l) The participation of the private sector in local governance, particularly in the delivery of basic services, shall be encouraged to ensure the viability of local autonomy as an alternative strategy for sustainable development; and</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(m) The national government shall ensure that decentralization contributes to the continuing improvement of the performance of local government units and the quality of community life.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 4. Scope of Application. &#8211; This Code shall apply to all provinces, cities, municipalities, barangays, and other political subdivisions as may be created by law, and, to the extent herein provided, to officials, offices, or agencies of the national government.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 5. Rules of Interpretation. &#8211; In the interpretation of the provisions of this Code, the following rules shall apply:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) Any provision on a power of a local government unit shall be liberally interpreted in its favor, and in case of doubt, any question thereon shall be resolved in favor of devolution of powers and of the lower local government unit. Any fair and reasonable doubt as to the existence of the power shall be interpreted in favor of the local government unit concerned;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) In case of doubt, any tax ordinance or revenue measure shall be construed strictly against the local government unit enacting it, and liberally in favor of the taxpayer. Any tax exemption, incentive or relief granted by any local government unit pursuant to the provisions of this Code shall be construed strictly against the person claiming it.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) The general welfare provisions in this Code shall be liberally interpreted to give more powers to local government units in accelerating economic development and upgrading the quality of life for the people in the community;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) Rights and obligations existing on the date of effectivity of this Code and arising out of contracts or any other source of prestation involving a local government unit shall be governed by the original terms and conditions of said contracts or the law in force at the time such rights were vested; and</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(e) In the resolution of controversies arising under this Code where no legal provision or jurisprudence applies, resort may be had to the customs and traditions in the place where the controversies take place.</p>
            <p align="center">CHAPTER II</p>
            <p align="center">General Powers and Attributes of Local Government Units</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 6. Authority to Create Local Government Units. &#8211; A local government unit may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundaries substantially altered either by law enacted by Congress in the case of a province, city, municipality, or any other political subdivision, or by ordinance passed by the sangguniang panlalawigan or sangguniang panlungsod concerned in the case of a barangay located within its territorial jurisdiction, subject to such limitations and requirements prescribed in this Code.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 7. Creation and Conversion. &#8211; As a general rule, the creation of a local government unit or its conversion from one level to another level shall be based on verifiable indicators of viability and projected capacity to provide services, to wit:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) Income. &#8211; It must be sufficient, based on acceptable standards, to provide for all essential government facilities and services and special functions commensurate with the size of its population, as expected of the local government unit concerned;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Population. &#8211; It shall be determined as the total number of inhabitants within the territorial jurisdiction of the local government unit concerned; and</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) Land Area. &#8211; It must be contiguous, unless it comprises two (2) or more islands or is separated by a local government unit independent of the others; properly identified by metes and bounds with technical descriptions; and sufficient to provide for such basic services and facilities to meet the requirements of its populace.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Compliance with the foregoing indicators shall be attested to by the Department of Finance (DOF), the National Statistics Office (NSO), and the Lands Management Bureau (LMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 8. Division and Merger. &#8211; Division and merger of existing local government units shall comply with the same requirements herein prescribed for their creation: Provided, however, That such division shall not reduce the income, population, or land area of the local government unit or units concerned to less than the minimum requirements prescribed in this Code: Provided, further, That the income classification of the original local government unit or units shall not fall below its current income classification prior to such division.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The income classification of local government units shall be updated within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Code to reflect the changes in their financial position resulting from the increased revenues as provided herein.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 9. Abolition of Local Government Units. &#8211; A local government unit may be abolished when its income, population, or land area has been irreversibly reduced to less than the minimum standards prescribed for its creation under Book III of this Code, as certified by the national agencies mentioned in Section 7 hereof to Congress or to the sanggunian concerned, as the case may be.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The law or ordinance abolishing a local government unit shall specify the province, city, municipality, or barangay with which the local government unit sought to be abolished will be incorporated or merged.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 10. Plebiscite Requirement. &#8211; No creation, division, merger, abolition, or substantial alteration of boundaries of local government units shall take effect unless approved by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite called for the purpose in the political unit or units directly affected. Said plebiscite shall be conducted by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of effectivity of the law or ordinance effecting such action, unless said law or ordinance fixes another date.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 11. Selection and Transfer of Local Government Site, Offices and Facilities. &#8211; (a) The law or ordinance creating or merging local government units shall specify the seat of government from where governmental and corporate services shall be delivered. In selecting said site, factors relating to geographical centrality, accessibility, availability of transportation and communication facilities, drainage and sanitation, development and economic progress, and other relevant considerations shall be taken into account.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) When conditions and developments in the local government unit concerned have significantly changed subsequent to the establishment of the seat of government, its sanggunian may, after public hearing and by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all its members, transfer the same to a site better suited to its needs. Provided, however, That no such transfer shall be made outside the territorial boundaries of the local government unit concerned.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The old site, together with the improvements thereon, may be disposed of by sale or lease or converted to such other use as the sanggunian concerned may deem beneficial to the local government unit concerned and its inhabitants.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) Local government offices and facilities shall not be transferred, relocated, or converted to other uses unless public hearings are first conducted for the purpose and the concurrence of the majority of all the members of the sanggunian concerned is obtained.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 12. Government Centers. &#8211; Provinces, cities, and municipalities shall endeavor to establish a government center where offices, agencies, or branches of the National Government, local government units, or government-owned or -controlled corporations may, as far as practicable, be located. In designating such a center, the local government unit concerned shall take into account the existing facilities of national and local agencies and offices which may serve as the government center as contemplated under this Section. The National Government, local government unit or government-owned or -controlled corporation concerned shall bear the expenses for the construction of its buildings and facilities in the government center.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 13. Naming of Local Government Units and Public Places, Streets and Structures. &#8211; (a) The sangguniang panlalawigan may, in consultation with the Philippine Historical Commission (PHC),  change the name of the following within its territorial jurisdiction:</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">(5) Any other public place or building owned by the municipal government.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) None of the foregoing local government units, institutions, places, or buildings shall be named after a living person, nor may a change of name be made unless for a justifiable reason and, in any case, not oftener than once every ten (10) years. The name of a local government unit or a public place, street or structure with historical, cultural, or ethnic significance shall not be changed, unless by a unanimous vote of the sanggunian concerned and in consultation with the PHC.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(e) A change of name of a public school shall be made only upon the recommendation of the local school board concerned.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">(h) In any change of name, the Office of the President, the representative of the legislative district concerned, and the Bureau of Posts shall be notified.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 14. Beginning of Corporate Existence. &#8211; When a new local government unit is created, its corporate existence shall commence upon the election and qualification of its chief executive and a majority of the members of its sanggunian, unless some other time is fixed therefor by the law or ordinance creating it.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 15. Political and Corporate Nature of Local Government Units. &#8211; Every local government unit created or recognized under this Code is a body politic and corporate endowed with powers to be exercised by it in conformity with law. As such, it shall exercise powers as a political subdivision of the national government and as a corporate entity representing the inhabitants of its territory.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 16. General Welfare. &#8211; Every local government unit shall exercise the powers expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance, and those which are essential to the promotion of the general welfare.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) The penalty of suspension shall not exceed the unexpired term of the respondent or a period of six (6) months for every administrative offense, nor shall said penalty be a bar to the candidacy of the respondent so suspended as long as he meets the qualifications required for the office.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 121. Who May Exercise. &#8211; The power of local initiative and referendum may be exercised by all registered voters of the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 122. Procedure in Local Initiative. &#8211; (a) Not less than one thousand (1,000) registered voters in case of provinces and cities, one hundred (100) in case of municipalities, and fifty (50) in case of barangays, may file a petition with the sanggunian concerned proposing the adoption, enactment, repeal, or amendment of an ordinance.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) If no favorable action thereon is taken by the sanggunian concerned within thirty (30) days from its presentation, the proponents, through their duly authorized and registered representatives, may invoke their power of initiative, giving notice thereof to the sanggunian concerned.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) The proposition shall be numbered serially starting from Roman numeral I. The COMELEC or its designated representative shall extend assistance in the formulation of the proposition.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) Two (2) or more propositions may be submitted in an initiative.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(e) Proponents shall have ninety (90) days in case of provinces and cities, sixty (60) days in case of municipalities, and thirty (30) days in case of barangays, from notice mentioned in subsection (b) hereof to collect the required number of signatures.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(f) The petition shall be signed before the election registrar, or his designated representatives, in the presence of a representative of the proponent, and a representative of the sanggunian concerned in a public place in the local government unit, as the case may be. Stations for collecting signatures may be established in as many places as may be warranted.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(g) Upon the lapse of the period herein provided, the COMELEC, through its office in the local government unit concerned, shall certify as to whether or not the required number of signatures has been obtained. Failure to obtain the required number defeats the proposition.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(h) If the required number of signatures is obtained, the COMELEC shall then set a date for the initiative during which the proposition shall be submitted to the registered voters in the local government unit concerned for their approval within sixty (60) days from the date of certification by the COMELEC, as provided in subsection (g) hereof, in case of provinces and cities, forty-five (45) days in case of municipalities, and thirty (30) days in case of barangays.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 123. Effectivity of Local Propositions. &#8211; If the proposition is approved by a majority of the votes cast, it shall take effect fifteen (15) days after certification by the COMELEC as if affirmative action thereon had been made by the sanggunian and local chief executive concerned. If it fails to obtain said number of votes, the proposition is considered defeated.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 124. Limitations on Local Initiative. &#8211; (a) The power of local initiative shall not be exercised more than once a year.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Initiative shall extend only to subjects or matters which are within the legal powers of the sanggunian to enact.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) If at any time before the initiative is held, the sanggunian concerned adopts in toto the proposition presented and the local chief executive approves the same, the initiative shall be cancelled. However, those against such action may, if they so desire, apply for initiative in the manner herein provided.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 125. Limitations upon Sanggunians. &#8211; Any proposition or ordinance approved through the system of initiative and referendum as herein provided shall not be repealed, modified or amended by the sanggunian concerned within six (6) months from the date of the approval thereof, and may be amended, modified or repealed by the sanggunian within three (3) years thereafter by a vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all its members: Provided, That in case of barangays, the period shall be eighteen (18) months after the approval thereof.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 126. Local Referendum Defined. &#8211; Local referendum is the legal process whereby the registered voters of the local government units may approve, amend or reject any ordinance enacted by the sanggunian.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">The COMELEC shall certify and proclaim the results of the said referendum.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 127.

In such case, the local treasurer or his deputy shall issue a duly authenticated certificate based upon the records of his office showing the fact of delinquency and the amounts of the tax, fee, or charge and penalty due. Such certificate shall serve as sufficient warrant for the distraint of personal property aforementioned, subject to the taxpayer&#8217;s right to claim exemption under the provisions of existing laws. Distrained personal property shall be sold at public auction in the manner herein provided for.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Accounting of distrained goods. &#8211; The officer executing the distraint shall make or cause to be made an account of the goods, chattels or effects distrained, a copy of which signed by himself shall be left either with the owner or person from whose possession the goods, chattels or effects are taken, or at the dwelling or place of business of that person and with someone of suitable age and discretion, to which list shall be added a statement of the sum demanded and a note of the time and place of sale.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Should the property distrained be not disposed of within one hundred and twenty (120) days from the date of distraint, the same shall be considered as sold to the local government unit concerned for the amount of the assessment made thereon by the Committee on Appraisal and to the extent of the same amount, the tax delinquencies shall be cancelled.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Said Committee on Appraisal shall be composed of the city or municipal treasurer as chairman, with a representative of the Commission on Audit and the city or municipal assessor as members.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(f) Disposition of proceeds &#8211; The proceeds of the sale shall be applied to satisfy the tax, including the surcharges, interest, and other penalties incident to delinquency, and the expenses of the distraint and sale. The balance over and above what is required to pay the entire claim shall be returned to the owner of the property sold. The expenses chargeable upon the seizure and sale shall embrace only the actual expenses of seizure and preservation of the property pending the sale, and no charge shall be imposed for the services of the local officer or his deputy. Where the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the claim, other property may, in like manner, be distrained until the full amount due, including all expenses, is collected.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 176.   Levy on Real Property. &#8211; After the expiration of the time required to pay the delinquent tax, fee, or charge, real property may be levied on before, simultaneously, or after the distraint of personal property belonging to the delinquent taxpayer.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">In case the levy on real property is not issued before or simultaneously with the warrant of distraint on personal property, and the personal property of the taxpayer is not sufficient to satisfy his delinquency, the provincial, city or municipal treasurer, as the case may be, shall within thirty (30) days after execution of the distraint, proceed with the levy on the taxpayer&#8217;s real property.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">A report on any levy shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of the warrant, be submitted by the levying officer to the sanggunian concerned.</p>

The advertisement shall contain the amount of taxes, fees or charges, and penalties due thereon, and the time and place of sale, the name of the taxpayer against whom the taxes, fees, or charges are levied, and a short description of the property to be sold. At any time before the date fixed for the sale, the taxpayer may stay the proceedings by paying the taxes, fees, charges, penalties and interests. If he fails to do so, the sale shall proceed and shall be held either at the main entrance of the provincial, city or municipal building, or on the property to be sold, or at any other place as determined by the local treasurer conducting the sale and specified in the notice of sale.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Within thirty (30) days after the sale, the local treasurer or his deputy shall make a report of the sale to the sanggunian concerned, and which shall form part of his records. After consultation with the sanggunian, the local treasurer shall make and deliver to the purchaser a certificate of sale, showing the proceedings of the sale, describing the property sold, stating the name of the purchaser and setting out the exact amount of all taxes, fees, charges, and related surcharges, interests, or penalties: Provided, however, That any excess in the proceeds of the sale over the claim and cost of sales shall be turned over to the owner of the property.</p>

It shall be the duty of the Registrar of Deeds concerned upon registration with his office of any such declaration of forfeiture to transfer the title of the forfeited property to the local government unit concerned without the necessity of an order from a competent court.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Within one (1) year from the date of such forfeiture, the taxpayer or any of his representative, may redeem the property by paying to the local treasurer the full amount of the real property tax and the related interest and the costs of sale.

The amount so deposited shall be paid to the purchaser at the auction sale if the deed is declared invalid but it shall be returned to the depositor if the action fails.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Neither shall any court declare a sale at public auction invalid by reason of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings unless the substantive rights of the delinquent owner of the real property or the person having legal interest therein have been impaired.</p>

Preparation of the Budget by the Local Chief Executive. &#8211; Upon receipt of the statements of income and expenditures from the treasurer, the budget proposals of the heads of departments and offices, and the estimates of income and budgetary ceilings from the local finance committee, the local chief executive shall prepare the executive budget for the ensuing fiscal year in accordance with the provisions of this Title.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The local chief executive shall submit the said executive budget to the sanggunian concerned not later than the sixteenth (16th) of October of the current fiscal year. Failure to submit such budget on the date prescribed herein shall subject the local chief executive to such criminal and administrative penalties as provided for under this Code and other applicable laws.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 319. Legislative Authorization of the Budget. &#8211; On or before the end of the current fiscal year, the sanggunian concerned shall, through an ordinance, the annual budget of the local government unit for the ensuing fiscal year on the basis of the estimates of income and expenditures submitted by the local chief executive.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 320. Effectivity of Budgets. &#8211; The ordinance enacting the annual budget shall take effect at the beginning of the ensuing calendar year. An ordinance enacting a supplemental budget, however, shall take effect upon its approval or on the date fixed therein.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The responsibility for the execution of the annual and supplemental budgets and the accountability therefor shall be vested primarily in the local chief executive concerned.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 321. Changes in the Annual Budget. &#8211; All budgetary proposals shall be included and considered in the budget preparation process. After the local chief executive concerned shall have submitted the executive budget to the sanggunian, no ordinance providing for a supplemental budget shall be enacted, except when supported by funds actually available as certified by the local treasurer or by new revenue sources.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">A supplemental budget may also be enacted in times of public calamity by way of budgetary realignment to set aside appropriations for the purchase of supplies and materials or the payment of services which are exceptionally urgent or absolutely indispensable to prevent imminent danger to, or loss of, life or property, in the jurisdiction of the local government unit or in other areas declared in a state of calamity by the President. Such ordinance shall clearly indicate the sources of funds available for appropriations, as certified under oath by the local treasurer and local accountant and attested to by the local chief executive, and the various items of appropriations affected and the reasons for the change.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 322. Reversion of Unexpended Balances of Appropriations, Continuing Appropriations. &#8211; Unexpended balances of appropriations authorized in the annual appropriations ordinance shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund at the end of the fiscal year and shall not thereafter be available for the expenditure except by subsequent enactment. However, appropriations for capital outlays shall continue and remain valid until fully spent, reverted or the project is completed. Reversions of continuing appropriations shall not be allowed unless obligations therefor have been fully paid or otherwise settled.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The balances of continuing appropriations shall be reviewed as part of the annual budget preparation and the sanggunian concerned may approve, upon recommendation of the local chief executive, the reversion of funds no longer needed in connection with the activities funded by said continuing appropriations subject to the provisions of this section.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 323. Failure to Enact the Annual Appropriations. &#8211; In case the sanggunian concerned fails to pass the ordinance authorizing the annual appropriations at the beginning of the ensuing fiscal year, it shall continue to hold sessions, without additional remuneration for its members, until such ordinance is approved, and no other business may be taken up during such sessions. If the sanggunian still fails to enact such ordinance after ninety (90) days from the beginning of the fiscal year, the ordinance authorizing the appropriations of the preceding year shall be deemed reenacted and shall remain in force and effect until the ordinance authorizing the proposed appropriations is passed by the sanggunian concerned. However, only the annual appropriations for salaries and wages of existing positions, statutory and contractual obligations, and essential operating expenses authorized in the annual and supplemental budgets for the preceding year shall be deemed reenacted and disbursement of funds shall be in accordance therewith.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the implementation of such reenacted ordinance, the local treasurer concerned shall exclude from the estimates of income for the preceding fiscal year those realized from nonrecurring sources, like national aids, proceeds from loans, sale of assets, prior year adjustments, and other analogous sources of income. No ordinance authorizing supplemental appropriations shall be passed in place of the annual appropriations.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In case the revised income estimates be less than the aggregate reenacted appropriations, the local treasurer concerned shall accordingly advise the sanggunian concerned which shall, within ten (10) days from the receipt of such advice, make the necessary adjustments or reductions. The revised appropriations authorized by the sanggunian concerned shall then be the basis for disbursements.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 324. Budgetary Requirements. &#8211; The budgets of local government units for any fiscal year shall comply with the following requirements:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The aggregate amount appropriated shall not exceed the estimates of income;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Full provision shall be made for all statutory and contractual obligations of the local government unit concerned: Provided, however, That the amount of appropriations for debt servicing shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the regular income of the local government unit concerned;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) In the case of provinces, cities, and municipalities, aid to component barangays shall be provided in amounts of not less than One thousand pesos (P1,000.00) per barangay; and</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) Five percent (5%) of the estimated revenue from regular sources shall be set aside as annual lump sum appropriations for relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and other works or services in connection with calamities which may occur during the budget year.  Provided, however, That such fund shall be used only in the area, or a portion thereof, of the local government unit or other areas affected by a disaster or calamity, as determined and declared by the local sanggunian concerned.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Calamity shall be defined as a state of extreme distress or misfortune, produced by some adverse circumstance or event or any great misfortune or cause or loss or misery caused by natural forces.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In case of fire or conflagration, the calamity fund shall be utilized only for relief operations.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The local development council shall more monitor the use and disbursement of the calamity fund.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 325. General Limitations. &#8211; The use of the provincial, city, and municipal funds shall be subject to the following limitations:</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">(a) The total appropriations, whether annual or supplemental, for personal services of a local government unit for one (1) fiscal year shall not exceed forty-five percent (45%) in the case of first to third class provinces, cities and municipalities, and fifty-five percent (55%) in the case of fourth class or lower, of the total annual income from regular sources realized in the next preceding fiscal year.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">(h) The annual appropriations for discretionary purposes of the local chief executive shall not exceed two percent (2%) of the actual receipts derived from basic real property tax in the next preceding calendar year. Discretionary funds shall be disbursed only for public purposes to be supported by appropriate vouchers and subject to such guidelines as may be prescribed by law. No amount shall be appropriated for the same purpose except as authorized under this section.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">If within ninety (90) days from receipt of copies of such ordinance, the sangguniang panlalawigan takes no action thereon, the same shall be deemed to have been reviewed in accordance with law and shall continue to be in full force and effect. If within the same period, the sangguniang panlalawigan shall have ascertained that the ordinance authorizing annual or supplemental appropriations has not complied with the requirements set forth in this Title, the sangguniang panlalawigan shall, within the ninety-day period hereinabove prescribed, declare such ordinance inoperative in its entirety or in part.

Upon receipt of such advice, the city or municipal treasurer concerned shall not make further disbursements of funds from any of the items of appropriation declared inoperative, disallowed or reduced.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 328.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) The territorial jurisdiction of the new barangay shall be properly identified by metes and bounds or by more or less permanent natural boundaries. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands.</p>
