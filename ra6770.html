                public officer or employee with a summary of the complaint and require him to submit a written answer
                within seventy-two hours from receipt thereof. If the answer is found satisfactory, it shall dismiss the
                case.<br><br>(3) When the complaint consists in delay or refusal to perform a duty required by law, or

                (4) Any delay or refusal to comply with the referral or directive of the Ombudsman or any of his
                Deputies, shall constitute a ground for administrative disciplinary action against the officer or
                employee to whom it was addressed.
