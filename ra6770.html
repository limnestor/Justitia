                appropriate administrative proceedings against erring public officers or employees, which shall be
                terminated within the period prescribed in the civil service law. Any delay without just cause in acting
                on any referral made by the Office of the Ombudsman shall be a ground for administrative action against

                the Office of the Ombudsman but not more than six months, without pay, except when the delay in the
                disposition of the case by the Office of the Ombudsman is due to the fault, negligence or petition of
                the respondent, in which case the period of such delay shall not be counted in computing the period of

                therefor. If it finds a reasonable ground to investigate further, it shall first furnish the respondent
                public officer or employee with a summary of the complaint and require him to submit a written answer
                within seventy-two hours from receipt thereof. If the answer is found satisfactory, it shall dismiss the

                (4) Any delay or refusal to comply with the referral or directive of the Ombudsman or any of his
                Deputies, shall constitute a ground for administrative disciplinary action against the officer or
                employee to whom it was addressed.<br><br>SEC. 27. <span style="font-style: italic;">Effectivity and Finality of Decisions.</span>&#8212;(1)
