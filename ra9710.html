                Congress assembled:</i><br><br>
                <center><b>CHAPTER I<br><br>GENERAL PROVISIONS</b></center>
                <br>SECTION 1. <i>Short Title.</i> &#8212; This Act shall be known as "The Magna Carta of
                Women".<br><br>SEC. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy.</i> &#8212; Recognizing that the economic, political,
                and sociocultural realities affect women's current condition, the State affirms the role of women in
                nation building and ensures the substantive equality of women and men. It shall promote empowerment of
                women and pursue equal opportunities for women and men and ensure equal access to resources and to
                development results and outcome. Further, the State realizes that equality of men and women entails the
                abolition of the unequal structures and practices that perpetuate discrimination and inequality. To
                realize this, the State shall endeavor to develop plans, policies, programs, measures, and mechanisms to
                address discrimination and inequality in the economic, political, social, and cultural life of women and
                men.<br><br>The State condemns discrimination against women in all its forms and pursues by all
                appropriate means and without delay the policy of eliminating discrimination against women in keeping
                with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and other
                international instruments consistent with Philippine law. The State shall accord women the rights,
                protection, and opportunities available to every member of society.<br><br>The State affirms women's
                rights as human rights and shall intensify its efforts to fulfill its duties under international and
                domestic law to recognize, respect, protect, fulfill, and promote all human rights and fundamental
                freedoms of women, especially marginalized women, in the economic, social, political, cultural, and
                other fields without distinction or discrimination on account of class, age, sex, gender, language,
                ethnicity, religion, ideology, disability, education, and status.<br><br>The State shall provide the
                necessary mechanisms to enforce women's rights and adopt and undertake all legal measures necessary to
                foster and promote the equal opportunity for women to participate in and contribute to the development
                of the political, economic, social, and cultural realms.<br><br>The State, in ensuring the full
                integration of women's concerns in the mainstream of development, shall provide ample opportunities to
                enhance and develop their skills, acquire productive employment and contribute to their families and
                communities to the fullest of their capabilities.<br><br>In pursuance of this policy, the State
                reaffirms the right of women in all sectors to participate in policy formulation, planning,
                organization, implementation, management, monitoring, and evaluation of all programs, projects, and
                services. It shall support policies, researches, technology, and training programs and other support
                services such as financing, production, and marketing to encourage active participation of women in
                national development.<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>Principles of Human Rights of Women.</i> &#8212; Human rights
                are universal and inalienable. All people in the world are entitled to them. The universality of human
                rights is encompassed in the words of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
                states that all human beings are free and equal in dignity and rights.<br><br>Human rights are
                indivisible. Human rights are inherent to the dignity of every human being whether they relate to civil,
                cultural, economic, political, or social issues.<br><br>Human rights are interdependent and
                interrelated. The fulfillment of one right often depends, wholly or in part, upon the fulfillment of
                others.<br><br>All individuals are equal as human beings by virtue of the inherent dignity of each human
                person. No one, therefore, should suffer discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, gender, age,
                language, sexual orientation, race, color, religion, political, or other opinion, national, social, or
                geographical origin, disability, property, birth, or other status as established by human rights
                standards.<br><br>All people have the right to participate in and access information relating to the
                decision-making processes that affect their lives and well-being. Rights-based approaches require a high
                degree of participation by communities, civil society, minorities, women, young people, indigenous
                peoples, and other identified groups.<br><br>States and other duty-bearers are answerable for the
                observance of human rights. They have to comply with the legal norms and standards enshrined in
                international human rights instruments in accordance with the Philippine Constitution. Where they fail
                to do so, aggrieved rights-holders are entitled to institute proceedings for appropriate redress before
                a competent court or other adjudicator in accordance with the rules and procedures provided by
                law.<br><br>
