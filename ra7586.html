                man's activities on all components of the natural environment particularly the effect of increasing
                population, resource exploitation and industrial advancement and recognizing the critical importance of
                protecting and maintaining the natural biological and physical diversities of the environment notably on
                areas with biologically unique features to sustain human life and development, as well as plant and
                animal life, it is hereby declared the policy of the State to secure for the Filipino people of present
                and future generations the perpetual existence of all native plants and animals through the
                establishment of a comprehensive system of integrated protected areas within the classification of
                national park as provided for in the Constitution.<br><br>It is hereby recognized that these areas,
                although distinct in features, possess common ecological values that may be incorporated into a holistic
                plan representative of our natural heritage; that effective administration of these areas is possible
                only through cooperation among national government, local government and concerned private
                organizations; that the use and enjoyment of these protected areas must be consistent with the
                principles of biological diversity and sustainable development.<br><br>To this end, there is hereby
                established a National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS), which shall encompass outstandingly
                remarkable areas and biologically important public lands that are habitats of rare and endangered
                species of plants and animals, biogeographic zones and related ecosystems, whether terrestrial, wetland
                or marine, all of which shall be designated as "protected areas."<br><br>SEC. 3. <span

                        3 hereof and report its findings to the President as soon as each study is completed. The study
                        must include in each area:<br><br>

                        <br>The DENR shall:<br><br>

                            the area or areas in the vicinity of the affected land thirty (30) days prior to the public
                            hearing;<br><br>(ii) Conduct public hearings at the locations nearest to the area
                            affected;<br><br>(iii) At least thirty (30) days prior to the date of hearing, advise all
                            local government units (LGUS) in the affected areas, national agencies concerned, people's
                            organizations and nongovernment organizations and invite such officials to submit their
                            views on the proposed action at the hearing not later than thirty (30) days following the
                            date of the hearing; and<br><br>(iv) Give due consideration to the recommendations at the
                            public hearing; and provide sufficient explanation for his recommendations contrary to the

                        proclamation designating the recommended areas as protected areas and providing for measures for
                        their protection until such time when Congress shall have enacted a law finally declaring such

                    <li> Thereafter, the President shall send to the Senate and the House of Representatives his
                        recommendations with respect to the designations as protected areas or reclassification of each
                        area on which review has been completed, together with maps and legal description of boundaries.
                        The President, in his recommendation, may propose the alteration of existing boundaries of any
                        or all proclaimed protected areas, addition of any contiguous area of public land of predominant
                        physical and biological value. Nothing contained herein shall limit the President to propose, as
                        part of his recommendation to Congress, additional areas which have not been designated,
                        proclaimed or set aside by law, presidential decree, proclamation or executive order as
                        protected area/s.
