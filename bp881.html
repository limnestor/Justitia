                made with the use of the corresponding copies in the national or provincial central files of registered
                voters: <i>Provided,</i> That if this is not feasible, the registered voter concerned may be summoned by
                the election registrar to effect such reconstitution by accomplishing a new application. Reconstituted
                forms shall be clearly marked with the word “reconstituted”.<br><br>The reconstitution of any lost or
                destroyed application for registration shall not affect the criminal liability of any person or persons

                duly signed or subscribed and sworn to by the members of the board of election inspectors and that
                failure to comply with this provision will constitute an election offense.<br><br>Any candidate or
                authorized representative of an accredited political party, upon formal request made to an election
                registrar, shall be entitled to a certified copy of the most recent list of voters in any precinct,

                possible with respect to the residence of the voters therein and whenever possible, such location shall
                be along a public road. No designation of polling places shall be changed except upon written petition
                of the majority of the voters of the precinct or agreement of all the political parties or by resolution
                of the Commission upon prior notice and hearing.<br><br>A public building having the requirements

                to effect the transfer of the polling place after the Commission found it to be located in violation of
                this section within the period prescribed herein shall be a ground for the postponement of the election

                place reserved for them and the table for the board of election inspectors and at a distance of not more
                than fifty centimeters from the latter so that the watchers may see and read clearly during the counting

                votes shall immediately depart. <i>(Sec. 138, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 194. <i>Manner of obtaining
                    ballots.</i> – The voter shall approach the chairman and shall give his name and address together

                if he does not have any, the board of election inspectors shall refer to his photograph and signature in
                the voter’s application for registration. If the board of election inspectors is satisfied with his
                identity, the chairman shall distinctly announce the voter’s name in a tone loud enough to be plainly
                heard throughout the polling place. If such voter has not been challenged, or if having been challenged,
                the question has been decided in his favor, the voter shall forthwith affix his signature in the proper
                space in the voting record, and the chairman shall, after first entering the number of the ballot in the
                corresponding space of the voting record, deliver to the voter one ballot correctly folded. No person

                hereof, nor stay therein for a longer time than necessary, nor speak with anyone other than as herein
                provided while inside the polling place. It shall be unlawful to prepare the ballot outside the voting

                if he has none, by any person of his confidence who belong to the same household or any member of the
                board of election inspectors, except the two party members: <i>Provided,</i> That no voter shall be
                allowed to vote as illiterate or physically disabled unless it is so indicated in his registration
                record: <i>Provided,</i> further, That in no case shall an assistor assist more than three times except
                the non-party members of the board of election inspectors. The person thus chosen shall prepare the
                ballot for the illiterate or disabled voter inside the voting booth. The person assisting shall bind
                himself in a formal document under oath to fill out the ballot strictly in accordance with the

                lawfully be used, he shall surrender if folded to the chairman who shall note in the corresponding space
                in the voting record that said ballot is spoiled. The voter shall then be entitled to another ballot
                which the chairman shall give him after announcing the serial number of the second ballot and recording
                said serial number in the corresponding spaces in the voting record. If the second ballot is again
                spoiled or defaced in such a way that it cannot lawfully be used, the same shall be surrendered to the
                chairman and recorded in the same manner as the first spoiled or defaced ballot. However, no voter shall
                change his ballot more than twice.<br><br>The spoiled ballot shall, without being unfolded and without
                removing the detachable coupon, be distinctly marked with the word “spoiled” and signed by the board of

                spoiled ballots. <i>(Sec. 142, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 198. <i>Voting.</i> – (a) After the voter has
                filled his ballot he shall fold it in the same manner as when he received it and return it to the
                chairman.<br><br>(b) In the presence of all the members of the board of election inspectors, he shall
                affix his thumbmark on the corresponding space in the coupon, and deliver the folded ballot to the
                chairman.<br><br>(c) The chairman, in the presence and view of the voter and all the members of the

                any other available finger nail, if there be no forefinger nail.<br><br>(e) The chairman shall sign in
                the proper space beside the thumbmark of the voter.<br><br>(f)The chairman, after finding everything to
                be in order, shall then detach the coupon in the presence of the board of election inspectors and of the
                voter and shall deposit the folded ballot in the compartment for valid ballots, and the detached coupon
                in the compartment for spoiled ballots.<br><br>(g)The voter shall then depart.<br><br>Any ballot
                returned to the chairman whose detachable coupon has been removed not in the presence of the board of
                election inspectors and of the voter, or any ballot whose number does not coincide with the number of
                the ballot delivered to the voter, as entered in the voting record, shall be considered as spoiled and
                shall be so marked and signed by the members of the board of election inspectors.<i> (Sec. 143, 1978
                    EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 199. <i>Challenge of illegal voters.</i> – (a) Any voter, or watcher may
                challenge any person offering to vote for not being registered, for using the name of another or
                suffering from existing disqualification. In such case, the board of election inspectors shall satisfy
                itself as to whether or not the ground for the challenge is true by requiring proof of registration or
                the identity of the voter; and<br><br>(b) No voter shall be required to present his voter’s affidavit on
                election day unless his identity is challenged. His failure or inability to produce his voter’s
                affidavit upon being challenged, shall not preclude him from voting if his identity be shown from the
                photograph, fingerprints, or specimen signatures in his approved application in the book of voters or if
                he is identified under oath by a member of the board of election inspectors and such identification
                shall be reflected in the minutes of the board.<br><br>SECTION 200. <i>Challenge based on certain
                    illegal acts.</i> – Any voter or watcher may challenge any voter offering to vote on the ground that
                the challenged person has received or expects to receive, has paid, offered or promised to pay, has
                contributed, offered or promised to contribute money or anything of value as consideration for his vote
                or for the vote of another; that he has made or received a promise to influence the giving or
                withholding of any such vote or that he has made a bet or is interested directly or indirectly in a bet
                which depends upon the result of the election. The challenged person shall take a prescribed oath before
                the board of election inspectors that he has not committed any of the acts alleged in the challenge.
                Upon the taking of such oath, the challenge shall be dismissed and the challenged voter shall be allowed
                to vote, but in case of his refusal to take such oath, the challenge shall be sustained and he shall not
                be allowed to vote. <i>(Sec. 145, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 201. <i>Admission of challenged vote
                    immaterial in criminal proceedings.</i> – The admission of the challenged vote under the two
                preceding sections shall not be conclusive upon any court as to the legality of the registration of the
                voter challenged or his vote in a criminal action against such person for illegal registration or
                voting. <i>(Sec. 146, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 202. <i>Record of challenges and oaths.</i> – The poll

                SECTION 206. <i>Counting to be Public and without Interruption</i>. - As soon as the voting is finished, the board of election inspectors shall publicly count in the polling place the votes cast and ascertain the results. The Board may rearrange the physical set up of the polling place for the counting or perform any other activity with respect to the transition from voting counting. However, it may do so only in the presence of the watchers and within close view of the public. At all times, the ballot boxes and all election documents and paraphernalia shall be within close view of the watchers and the public.<br><br>The board of election inspectors shall not adjourn or postpone or delay the count until it has been fully completed, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.<br><br>The Commission, in the interest of free, orderly, and honest elections, may authorize the board of election inspectors to count the votes and to accomplish the election returns and other forms prescribed under this Code in any other place within a public building in the same municipality or city on account of imminent danger of widespread violence or similar causes of comparable magnitude: <i>Provided,</i> That the transfer shall have been recommended in writing by the board of election inspectors by unanimous vote and endorsed in writing by the majority of watchers present: <i>Provided, further,</i> That the said public building shall not be located within the perimeter of or inside a military or police camp, reservation, headquarters, detachment or field office nor within the premises of a prison or detention bureau or any law enforcement or investigation agency.<br><br>Any violation of this section, or its pertinent portion, shall constitute an election offense and shall be penalized in accordance with Batas Pambansa Blg. 881.

                <br><br>SECTION 207.<i> Excess ballots.</i> – Before proceeding to count the votes the board of
                election inspectors shall count the ballots in the compartment for valid ballots without unfolding them
                or exposing their contents, except so far as to ascertain that each ballot is single, and compare the
                number of ballots in the box with the number of voters who have voted. If there are excess ballots, they
                shall be returned in the box and thoroughly mixed therein, and the poll clerk, without seeing the
                ballots and with his back to the box, shall publicly draw out as many ballots as may be equal to the
                excess and without unfolding them, place them in an envelope which shall be marked “excess ballots” and
                which shall be sealed and signed by the members of the board of election inspectors. The envelope shall
                be placed in the compartment for valid ballots, but its contents shall not be read in the counting of
                votes. If in the course of the examination ballots are found folded together before they were deposited
                in the box, they shall be placed in the envelope for excess ballots. In case ballots with their
                detachable coupons be found in the box, such coupons shall be removed and deposited in the compartment
                for spoiled ballots, and the ballots shall be included in the file of valid ballots. If ballots with the
                words “spoiled” be found in the box, such ballots shall likewise be placed in the compartment for
                spoiled ballots. <i>(Sec. 151, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 208. <i>Marked ballots.</i> – The board of
                election inspectors shall then unfold the ballots and determine whether there are any marked ballots,
                and, if any be found, they shall be placed in an envelope labelled “marked ballots” which shall be
                sealed and signed by the members of the board of election inspectors and placed in the compartment for
                valid ballots and shall not be counted. A majority vote of the board of election inspectors shall be
                sufficient to determine whether any ballot is marked or not. Non-official ballots which the board of
                election inspectors may find, except those which have been used as emergency ballots, shall be
                considered as marked ballots. <i>(Sec. 152, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 209. <i>Compartment for spoiled
                    ballots.</i> – The ballots deposited in the compartment for spoiled ballots shall be presumed to be
                spoiled ballots, whether or not they contain such notation; but if the board of election inspectors
                should find that during the voting any valid ballot was erroneously deposited in this compartment, or if
                any ballot separated as excess or marked had been erroneously deposited therein, the board of election
                inspectors shall open said compartment after the voting and before the counting of votes for the sole
                purpose of drawing out the ballots erroneously deposited therein. It shall then prepare and sign a
                statement of such fact and lock the box with its three keys immediately thereafter. The valid ballots so
                withdrawn shall be mixed with the other valid ballots, and the excess or marked ballots shall be placed
                in their proper envelopes which shall for such purposes be opened and again labelled, sealed, signed and
                kept as hereinafter provided. <i>(Sec. 153, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 210. <i>Manner of counting
                    votes.</i> – The counting of votes shall be made in the following manner: the board of election
                inspectors shall unfold the ballots and form separate piles of one hundred ballots each, which shall be
                held together with rubber bands, with cardboard of the size of the ballots to serve as folders. The
                chairman of the board of election inspectors shall take the ballots of the first pile one by one and
                read the names of candidates voted for and the offices for which they were voted in the order in which
                they appear thereon, assuming such a position as to enable all of the watchers to read such names. The
                chairman shall sign and affix his right hand thumbmark at the back of the ballot immediately after it is
                counted. The poll clerk, and the third member, respectively, shall record on the election returns and
                the tally board or sheet each vote as the names voted for each office are read.<br><br>Each vote shall
                be recorded by a vertical line, except every fifth vote which shall be recorded by a diagonal line
                crossing the previous four vertical lines. One party member shall see to it that the chairman reads the
                vote as written on the ballot, and the other shall check the recording of the votes on the tally board
                or sheet and the election returns seeing to it that the same are correctly accomplished. After finishing
                the first pile of ballots, the board of election inspectors shall determine the total number of votes
                recorded for each candidate, the sum being noted on the tally board or sheet and on the election
                returns. In case of discrepancy such recount as may be necessary shall be made. The ballots shall then
                be grouped together again as before the reading. Thereafter, the same procedure shall be followed with
                the second pile of ballots and so on successively. After all the ballots have been read, the board of
                election inspectors shall sum up the totals recorded for each candidate, and the aggregate sum shall be
                recorded both on the tally board or sheet and on the election returns. It shall then place the counted
                ballots in an envelope provided for the purpose, which shall be closed, signed and deposited in the
                compartment for valid ballots. The tally board or sheet as accomplished and certified by the board of
                election inspectors shall not be changed or destroyed but shall be kept in the compartment for valid
                ballots <i>(Sec. 154, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 211. <i>Rules for the appreciation of ballots.</i> –
                In the reading and appreciation of ballots, every ballot shall be presumed to be valid unless there is
                clear and good reason to justify its rejection. The board of election inspectors shall observe the
                following rules, bearing in mind that the object of the election is to obtain the expression of the
                voters’ will:<br>
                <blockquote>1. Where only the first name of a candidate or only his surname is written, the vote for
                    such candidate is valid, if there is no other candidate with the same first name or surname for the
                    same office.<br><br>2. Where only the first name of a candidate is written on the ballot, which when
                    read, has a sound similar to the surname of another candidate, the vote shall be counted in favor of
                    the candidate with such surname. If there are two or more candidates with the same full name, first
                    name or surname and one of them is the incumbent, and on the ballot is written only such full name,
                    first name or surname, the vote shall be counted in favor of the incumbent.<br><br>3. In case the
                    candidate is a woman who uses her maiden or married surname or both and there is another candidate
                    with the same surname, a ballot bearing only such surname shall be counted in favor of the candidate
                    who is an incumbent.<br><br>4. When two or more words are written on the same line on the ballot,
                    all of which are the surnames of two or more candidates, the same shall not be counted for any of
                    them, unless one is a surname of an incumbent who has served for at least one year in which case it
                    shall be counted in favor of the latter.<br><br>When two or more words are written on different
                    lines on the ballot all of which are the surnames of two or more candidates bearing the same surname
                    for an office for which the law authorizes the election of more than one and there are the same
                    number of such surnames written as there are candidates with that surname, the vote shall be counted
                    in favor of all the candidates bearing the surname.<br><br>5. When on the ballot is written a single
                    word which is the first name of a candidate and which is at the same time the surname of his
                    opponent, the vote shall be counted in favor of the latter.<br><br>6. When two words are written on
                    the ballot, one of which is the first name of the candidate and the other is the surname of his
                    opponent, the vote shall not be counted for either.<br><br>7. A name or surname incorrectly written
                    which, when read, has a sound similar to the name or surname of a candidate when correctly written
                    shall be counted in his favor;<br><br>8. When a name of a candidate appears in a space of the ballot
                    for an office for which he is a candidate and in another space for which he is not a candidate, it
                    shall be counted in his favor for the office for which he is a candidate and the vote for the office
                    for which he is not a candidate shall be considered as stray, except when it is used as a means to
                    identify the voter, in which case, the whole ballot shall be void.<br><br>If the word or words
                    written on the appropriate blank on the ballot is the identical name or surname or full name, as the
                    case may be, of two or more candidates for the same office none of whom is an incumbent, the vote
                    shall be counted in favor of that candidate to whose ticket belong all the other candidates voted
                    for in the same ballot for the same constituency.<br><br>9. When in a space in the ballot there
                    appears a name of a candidate that is erased and another clearly written, the vote is valid for the
                    latter.<br><br>10. The erroneous initial of the first name which accompanies the correct surname of
                    a candidate, the erroneous initial of the surname accompanying the correct first name of a
                    candidate, or the erroneous middle initial of the candidate shall not annul the vote in favor of the
                    latter.<br><br>11. The fact that there exists another person who is not a candidate with the first
                    name or surname of a candidate shall not prevent the adjudication of the vote of the latter.<br><br>12.
                    Ballots which contain prefixes such as “Sir.”, “Mr.”, “Datu”, “Don”, “Ginoo”, “Hon.”, “Gob.” or
                    suffixes like “Hijo”, “Jr.”, “Segundo”, are valid.<br><br>13. The use of the nicknames and
                    appellations of affection and friendship, if accompanied by the first name or surname of the
                    candidate, does not annul such vote, except when they were used as a means to identify the voter, in
                    which case the whole ballot is invalid: <i>Provided,</i> That if the nickname used is unaccompanied
                    by the name or surname of a candidate and it is the one by which he is generally or popularly known
                    in the locality, the name shall be counted in favor of said candidate, if there is no other
                    candidate for the same office with the same nickname.<br><br>14. Any vote containing initials only
                    or which is illegible or which does not sufficiently identify the candidate for whom it is intended
                    shall be considered as a stray vote but shall not invalidate the whole ballot.<br><br>15. If on the
                    ballot is correctly written the first name of a candidate but with a different surname, or the
                    surname of the candidate is correctly written but with different first name, the vote shall not be
                    counted in favor of any candidate having such first name and/or surname but the ballot shall be
                    considered valid for other candidates.<br><br>16. Any ballot written with crayon, lead pencil, or in
                    ink, wholly or in part, shall be valid.<br><br>17. Where there are two or more candidates voted for
                    in an office for which the law authorizes the election of only one, the vote shall not be counted in
                    favor of any of them, but this shall not affect the validity of the other votes therein.<br><br>18.
                    If the candidates voted for exceed the number of those to be elected, the ballot is valid, but the
                    votes shall be counted only in favor of the candidates whose names were firstly written by the voter
                    within the spaces provided for said office in the ballot until the authorized number is covered.<br><br>19.
                    Any vote in favor of a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy or in favor of a
                    candidate for an office for which he did not present himself shall be considered as a stray vote but
                    it shall not invalidate the whole ballot.<br><br>20. Ballots containing the name of a candidate
                    printed and pasted on a blank space of the ballot or affixed thereto through any mechanical process
                    are totally null and void.<br><br>21. Circles, crosses or lines put on the spaces on which the voter
                    has not voted shall be considered as signs to indicate his desistance from voting and shall not
                    invalidate the ballot.<br><br>22. Unless it should clearly appear that they have been deliberately
                    put by the voter to serve as identification marks, commas, dots, lines, or hyphens between the first
                    name and surname of a candidate, or in other parts of the ballot, traces of the letter “T”, “J”, and
                    other similar ones, the first letters or syllables of names which the voter does not continue, the
                    use of two or more kinds of writing and unintentional or accidental flourishes, strokes, or strains,
                    shall not invalidate the ballot.<br><br>23. Any ballot which clearly appears to have been filled by
                    two distinct persons before it was deposited in the ballot box during the voting is totally null and
                    void.<br><br>24. Any vote cast in favor of a candidate who has been disqualified by final judgment
                    shall be considered as stray and shall not be counted but it shall not invalidate the
                    ballot.<br><br>25. Ballots wholly written in Arabic in localities where it is of general use are
                    valid. To read them, the board of election inspectors may employ an interpreter who shall take an
                    oath that he shall read the votes correctly.<br><br>26. The accidental tearing or perforation of a
                    ballot does not annul it.<br><br>27. Failure to remove the detachable coupon from a ballot does not
                    annul such ballot.<br><br>28. A vote for the President shall also be a vote for the Vice-President
                    running under the same ticket of a political party, unless the voter votes for a Vice-President who
                    does not belong to such party. <i>(Sec. 155, 1978 EC)</i></blockquote>

                place, it shall be the duty of the board of election inspectors to issue a certificate of the number of
                the votes received by a candidate upon request of the watchers. All the members of the board of election
                inspectors shall sign the certificate. <i>(Sec. 159, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 216. <i>Alterations and

                date of the election or twenty-four hours from the time a copy of the election returns concerned is
                opened by the board of canvassers, whichever is earlier. The petition shall be accompanied by proof of
                service upon all candidates affected. If the petition is by all members of the board of election
                inspectors and the results of the election would not be affected by said correction and none of the
                candidates affected objects thereto, the Commission, upon being satisfied of the veracity of the

                necessary for this purpose, and shall provide the necessary facilities for said delivery at the expense
                of the city or municipality. The book of voters shall be returned to the election registrar who shall
                keep it under his custody. The treasurer and the election registrar, as the case may be, shall on the
                day after the election require the members of the board of election inspectors who failed to send the

                detail. <i>(Sec. 161, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 218. <i>Preservation of the voting record.</i> – The
                voting record of each polling place shall be delivered to the election registrar who shall have custody
                of the same, keeping them in a safe place, until such time that the Commission shall give instructions
                on their disposition. <i>(Sec. 43, BP 697)</i><br><br>SECTION 219. <i>Preservation of the ballot boxes,
                    their keys and disposition of their contents.</i> – (a) The provincial election supervisor, the
                provincial treasurer and the provincial fiscal shall keep the envelope containing the keys in their
                possession intact during the period of three months following the election. Upon the lapse of this
                period, unless the Commission has ordered otherwise, the provincial election supervisor and the
                provincial fiscal shall deliver to the provincial treasurer the envelope containing the keys under their
                custody.<br><br>(b) The city and municipal treasurer shall keep the ballot boxes under their
                responsibility for three months and stored unopened in a secure place, unless the Commission orders
                otherwise whenever said ballot boxes are needed in any political exercise which might be called within
                the said period, provided these are not involved in any election contest or official investigation, or
                the Commission or other competent authority shall demand them sooner or shall order their preservation
                for a longer time in connection with any pending contest or investigation. However, upon showing by any
                candidate that the boxes will be in danger of being violated if kept in the possession of such
                officials, the Commission may order them kept by any other official whom it may designate. Upon the
                lapse of said time and if there should be no order to the contrary, the Commission may authorize the
                city and municipal treasurer in the presence of its representative to open the boxes and burn their
                contents, except the copy of the minutes of the voting and the election returns deposited therein which
                they shall take and keep.<br><br>(c) In case of calamity or fortuitous event such as fire, flood, storm,
                or other similar calamities which may actually cause damage to the ballot boxes and/or their contents,
                the Commission may authorize the opening of said ballot boxes to salvage the ballots and other contents
                by placing them in other ballot boxes, taking such other precautionary measures as may be necessary to
                preserve such documents. <i>(Sec. 162, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 220. <i>Documents and articles
                    omitted or erroneously placed inside the ballot box.</i> – If after the delivery of the keys of the
                ballot box to the proper authorities, the board of election inspectors shall discover that some
                documents or articles required to be placed in the ballot box were not placed therein, the board of
                election inspectors, instead of opening the ballot box in order to place therein said documents or
                articles, shall deliver the same to the Commission or its duly authorized representatives. In no
                instance shall the ballot box be reopened to place therein or take out therefrom any document or article
                except to retrieve copies of the election returns which will be needed in any canvass and in such
                excepted instances, the members of the board of election inspectors and watchers of the candidates shall
                be notified of the time and place of the opening of said ballot box: <i><i>Provided,</i> however,</i>
                That if there are other copies of the election returns outside of the ballot box which can be used in
                canvass, such copies of the election returns shall be used in said canvass and the opening of the ballot
                box to retrieve copies of the election returns placed therein shall then be dispensed with.<i> (Sec.

                means of communication a certified copy thereof, and making available the data contained therein to the

                subsidiaries or of any member of a privately owned or operated security, investigative, protective or

                room: <i><i>Provided,</i> however,</i> That the board of canvassers by a majority vote, if it deems
                necessary, may make a call in writing for the detail of policemen or any peace officers for their
                protection or for the protection of the election documents and paraphernalia in the possession of the
                board, or for the maintenance of peace and order, in which case said policemen or peace officers, who
                shall be in proper uniform, shall stay outside the room within a radius of thirty meters near enough to
                be easily called by the board of canvassers at any time.<i> (New)</i><br><br>SECTION 233. <i>When the
                    election returns are delayed, lost or destroyed.</i> – In case its copy of the election returns is
                missing, the board of canvassers shall, by messenger or otherwise, obtain such missing election returns
                from the board of election inspectors concerned, or if said returns have been lost or destroyed, the
                board of canvassers, upon prior authority of the Commission, may use any of the authentic copies of said
                election returns or a certified copy of said election returns issued by the Commission, and forthwith
                direct its representative to investigate the case and immediately report the matter to the
                Commission.<br><br>The board of canvassers, notwithstanding the fact that not all the election returns
                have been received by it, may terminate the canvass and proclaim the candidates elected on the basis of
                the available election returns if the missing election returns will not affect the results of the
                election. <i>(Sec. 171, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 234. <i>Material defects in the election
                    returns.</i> – If it should clearly appear that some requisites in form or data had been omitted in
                the election returns, the board of canvassers shall call for all the members of the board of election
                inspectors concerned by the most expeditious means, for the same board to effect the correction: <i>Provided,</i>
                That in case of the omission in the election returns of the name of any candidate and/or his
                corresponding votes, the board of canvassers shall require the board of election inspectors concerned to
                complete the necessary data in the election returns and affix therein their initials: <i>Provided,</i>
                further, That if the votes omitted in the returns cannot be ascertained by other means except by
                recounting the ballots, the Commission, after satisfying itself that the identity and integrity of the
                ballot box have not been violated, shall order the board of election inspectors to open the ballot box,
                and, also after satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has been duly preserved,
                order the board of election inspectors to count the votes for the candidate whose votes have been
                omitted with notice thereof to all candidates for the position involved and thereafter complete the
                returns.<br><br>The right of a candidate to avail of this provision shall not be lost or affected by the
                fact that an election protest is subsequently filed by any of the candidates. <i>(Sec. 172, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION
                235. <i>When election returns appear to be tampered with or falsified.</i> – If the election returns
                submitted to the board of canvassers appear to be tampered with, altered or falsified after they have
                left the hands of the board of election inspectors, or otherwise not authentic, or were prepared by the
                board of election inspectors under duress, force, intimidation, or prepared by persons other than the
                member of the board of election inspectors, the board of canvassers shall use the other copies of said
                election returns and, if necessary, the copy inside the ballot box which upon previous authority given
                by the Commission may be retrieved in accordance with Section 220 hereof. If the other copies of the
                returns are likewise tampered with, altered, falsified, not authentic, prepared under duress, force,
                intimidation, or prepared by persons other than the members of the board of election inspectors, the
                board of canvassers or any candidate affected shall bring the matter to the attention of the Commission.
                The Commission shall then, after giving notice to all candidates concerned and after satisfying itself
                that nothing in the ballot box indicate that its identity and integrity have been violated, order the
                opening of the ballot box and, likewise after satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots
                therein has been duly preserved shall order the board of election inspectors to recount the votes of the
                candidates affected and prepare a new return which shall then be used by the board of canvassers as
                basis of the canvass. <i>(Sec. 173, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 236. <i>Discrepancies in election
                    returns.</i> – In case it appears to the board of canvassers that there exists discrepancies in the
                other authentic copies of the election returns from a polling place or discrepancies in the votes of any
                candidate in words and figures in the same return, and in either case the difference affects the results
                of the election, the Commission, upon motion of the board of canvassers or any candidate affected and
                after due notice to all candidates concerned, shall proceed summarily to determine whether the integrity
                of the ballot box had been preserved, and once satisfied thereof shall order the opening of the ballot
                box to recount the votes cast in the polling place solely for the purpose of determining the true result
                of the count of votes of the candidates concerned. <i>(Sec. 174, 1978 EC)</i><br><br>SECTION 237. <i>When
                    integrity of ballots is violated.</i> – If upon the opening of the ballot box as ordered by the
