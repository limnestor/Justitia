                activities;<br><br>WHEREAS, to facilitate investment, there is a need to adopt a cohesive and
                consolidated investments incentives law;<br><br>WHEREAS, it is imperative to integrate basic laws on
                investment, to clarify and harmonize their provisions for the guidance of domestic and foreign
                investors.<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, CORAZON C. AQUINO, President of the Philippines, do hereby order
                and ordain the following:<br><br>
                <center><b>PRELIMINARY TITLE</b><br>CHAPTER I. - TITLE AND DECLARATION OF POLICY<br></center>
                <br>ARTICLE 1. <i>Short Title</i>. - This Order shall be known as the Omnibus. Investments Code of 1987.<br><br>ART.
                2. <i>Declaration of Investment Policies</i>. - To accelerate the sound development of the national
                economy in consonance with the principles and objectives of economic nationalism and in pursuance of a
                planned economically feasible and practical dispersal of industries and the promotion of small and
                medium scale industries, under conditions which will encourage competition and discourage monopolies,
                the following are declared policies of the State:<br><br>1. The State shall encourage private Filipino
                and foreign investments in industry, agriculture, forestry, mining, tourism and other sectors of the
                economy which shall: provide significant employment opportunities relative to the amount of the capital
                being invested; increase productivity of the land, minerals, forestry, aquatic and other resources of
                the country, and improve utilization of the products thereof; improve technical skills of the people
                employed in the enterprise; provide a foundation for the future development of the economy; meet the
                tests of international competitiveness; accelerate development of less developed regions of the country;
                and result in increased volume and value of exports for the economy.<br><br>2. The State shall ensure
                holistic development by safeguarding the well-being of the social, cultural and ecological life of the
                people. For this purpose, consultation with affected communities will be conducted whenever
                necessary.<br><br>3. The State shall extend to projects which will significantly contribute to the
                attainment of these objectives, fiscal incentives without which said projects may not be established in
                the locales, number and/or pace required for optimum national economic development. Fiscal incentives
                systems shall be devised to compensate for market imperfections, to reward performance contributing to
                economic development, to cost-efficient and be simple to administer.<br><br>4. The State considers the
                private sector as the prime mover for economic growth. In this regard, private initiative is to be
                encouraged, with deregulation and self-regulation of business activities to be generally adopted where
                dictated by urgent social concerns.<br><br>5. The State shall principally play a supportive role, rather
                than a competitive one, providing the framework, the climate and the incentives within which business
                activity is to take place.<br><br>6. The State recognizes that there are appropriate roles for local and
                foreign capital to play in the development of the Philippine economy and that it is the responsibility
                of Government to define these roles and provide the climate for their entry and growth.<br><br>7. The
                State recognizes that industrial peace is an essential element of economic growth and that it is a
                principal responsibility of the State to ensure that such a condition prevails.<br><br>8. Fiscal
                incentives shall be extended to stimulate the establishment and assist initial operations of the
                enterprise, and shall terminate after a period of not more than 10 years from registration or start-up
                of operation unless a specific period is otherwise stated.<br><br>The foregoing declaration of
                investment policies shall apply to all investment incentive schemes.<br><br>
