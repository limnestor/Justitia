                style="font-style: italic;">WHEREAS</span>, the effectiveness of the Government will be enhanced by a

            procedural principles and rules of governance; and<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">WHEREAS</span>,
            a new Administrative Code will be of optimum benefit to the people and Government officers and employees as

            decisions of subordinate officials or units; determine priorities in the execution of plans and programs;
            and prescribe standards, guidelines, plans and programs. Unless a different meaning is explicitly provided
            in the specific law governing the relationship of particular agencies, the word "control" shall encompass
            supervision and control as defined in this paragraph. <br><br>(2) <span style="font-style: italic;">Administrative Supervision.</span>
            - (a) Administrative supervision which shall govern the administrative relationship between a department or
            its equivalent and regulatory agencies or other agencies as may be provided by law, shall be limited to the
            authority of the department or its equivalent to generally oversee the operations of such agencies and to
            insure that they are managed effectively, efficiently and economically but without interference with
            day-to-day activities; or require the submission of reports and cause the conduct of management audit,
            performance evaluation and inspection to determine compliance with policies, standards and guidelines of the

            the department or its equivalent and the attached agency or corporation for purposes of policy and program
            coordination. The coordination may be accomplished by having the department represented in the governing
            board of the attached agency or corporation, either as chairman or as a member, with or without voting
            rights, if this is permitted by the charter; having the attached corporation or agency comply with a system
            of periodic reporting which shall reflect the progress of programs and projects; and having the department
            or its equivalent provide general policies through its representative in the board, which shall serve as the
            framework for the internal policies of the attached corporation or agency; <br><br>(b) Matters of day-to-day
            administration or all those pertaining to internal operations shall be left to the discretion or judgment of
            the executive officer of the agency or corporation. In the event that the Secretary and the head of the
            board or the attached agency or corporation strongly disagree on the interpretation and application of
            policies, and the Secretary is unable to resolve the disagreement, he shall bring the matter to the
            President for resolution and direction; <br><br>(c) Government-owned or controlled corporations attached to
            a department shall submit to the Secretary concerned their audited financial statements within sixty (60)
            days after the close of the fiscal year; and <br><br>(d) Pending submission of the required financial
            statements, the corporation shall continue to operate on the basis of the preceding year's budget until the
            financial statements shall have been submitted. Should any government-owned or controlled corporation incur
            an operation deficit at the close of its fiscal year, it shall be subject to administrative supervision of
            the department; and the corporation's operating and capital budget shall be subject to the department's

            control, the authority of the department shall be governed by the provisions of Chapter 9 of this book. <br><br>(2)

            children; <br>(e) That said agency is located in a place or community where children should not be, or is
            physically dangerous to children or would unduly expose children to crime, vice, immorality, corruption or
            severe cruelty; or <br>(f) That said agency has by any act or commission shown its incompetence or
            unworthiness to continue acting as a child welfare agency. During the period of suspension, the agency
            concerned shall not accept or admit any additional children. In any case, the Department shall make such
            order as to the custody of the children under the care of such agency as the circumstances may warrant. The
            suspension may last for as long as the agency has not complied with any order of the Department to remove or
            remedy the conditions which have given rise to the suspension. The aggrieved agency may appeal the
            suspension or revocation in a proper court action. In such a case, the court shall within fifteen (15) days
            from the filing of the Department's answer, conduct a hearing and decide the case, either by lifting the
            suspension, or continuing it for such period of time as it may order, or by revoking the license of the
            agency where the Department has proven the revocation to be justified. <br><br>Section 26. <span

            <br>Section 3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Declaration of Policy. -</span> It is hereby declared the
            policy of the State to formulate and implement a National Budget that is an instrument of national
            development, reflective of national objectives, strategies and plans. The budget shall be supportive of and
            consistent with the socio-economic development plan and shall be oriented towards the achievement of
            explicit objectives and expected results, to ensure that funds are utilized and operations are conducted
            effectively, economically and efficiently. The national budget shall be formulated within the context of a
            regionalized government structure and borrowings of all levels of government and of government-owned or
            controlled corporations. The budget shall likewise be prepared within the context of the national long-term
            plan and of a long-term budget program. <br><br>Section 4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Planning and Budgeting Linkage.</span>
            - The budget shall be formulated as an instrument for the attainment of national development goals and as
            part of the planning-programming-budgeting continuum. Levels of revenue, expenditure and debt shall be
            established in relation to macro-economic targets of growth, employment levels, and price level change, and
            shall be developed consistent with domestic and foreign debt, domestic credit and balance of payments
            objectives for the budget period. The aggregate magnitudes of the budget shall be determined in close
            consultation among the planning and fiscal agencies of government. Budgetary priorities shall be those
            specified in the approved national plans, keeping in mind the capability and performance of the implementing
            agencies concerned. Agency budget proposals shall explicitly state linkage to approved agency plans.
            <br><br>Section 5<span style="font-style: italic;">. National Resource Budget. -</span> The finances of
            government shall be analyzed and determined as the aggregate of revenue, expenditure and debt of all units
            of government, including the national government and its agencies and instrumentalities, local government
            units and government-owned or controlled corporations. The national government budget shall be evolved
            within the framework of the total impact of government activity on the national economy. The budgets of
            government corporations and local governments shall be consistent in form and timing with that of the
            national government, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. <br><br>Section 6. <span
                style="font-style: italic;">Regional Budgeting. </span>- The budgets of national government agencies
            shall take into full and explicit consideration the goals, plans and requirements of their respective
            regional offices, in the interest of full government response to local thinking and initiative. The budget
            preparation process shall originate at regional and local levels, and shall be consolidated and reviewed by
            the central offices of the various national agencies. The regional development strategies and plans,
            including physical framework and resource-use plans, shall be considered in the preparation of the budget.
            <br><br>Section 7<span style="font-style: italic;">. Long Term Budgeting. - </span>The annual budgets of the
            national government shall be prepared as an integral part of a long-term budget picture. The long-term
            economic and physical framework plans of government, multi-year requirements of approved programs and
            projects, organizational and personnel development strategies, and other commitments entered into or
            otherwise assumed by government shall be specified in the budget process. <br><br>Section 8.<span
                style="font-style: italic;"> Development Projects. -</span> The development process requires the
            implementation of major development projects of such size as to significantly affect the infrastructure
            program, debt ceilings, the balance of payments, domestic credit, and government expenditure levels. The
            budget process shall formally consider the timing of major national projects, in order to ensure the
            observance of established fiscal, monetary, international payments, and other constraints. <br><br>Section
            9. <span style="font-style: italic;">Performance and Financial Review.</span> - The analysis of agency
            operating performance, the evaluation of performance, the evaluation of performance relative to costs
            incurred and the review of agency operating systems and procedures are inherent parts of the budget process.
            Agencies shall therefore design and implement (1) management information systems yielding both performance
            and financial information which will adequately monitor and control budget implementation, and (2)
            improvements in operating systems, procedures and practices, so as to ensure that the targets approved in
            budget authorization are in fact attained at minimum cost. <br><br>Section 10. <span
                style="font-style: italic;">Compensation and Position Classification. -</span> The size of personnel
            services expenditures relative to the total budget and the number of agencies and personnel in government
            call for an effective national compensation and position classification policy. The Constitutional principle
            of a single compensation scheme for the government and its instrumentalities is one of the bases of the
            government budget process. <br><br style="font-style: italic;">

            - The ordinary income of government shall be used primarily to provide appropriations for current
            operations, except in case of a national emergency or serious financial stress, the existence of which has
            been duly proclaimed by the President. <br><br>The level of aggregate revenue expenditure and debt shall be

            Development Budget Coordination Committee of the National Economic and Development Authority. <br>No
            appropriations for current operations and capital outlays of the Government shall be proposed unless the
            amount involved is covered by the ordinary income, or unless it is supported by a proposal creating
            additional sources of funds or revenue, including those generated from domestic and foreign borrowings,
            sufficient to cover the same. Likewise, no appropriation for any expenditure, the amount of which is not
            covered by the estimated income from the existing sources of revenue or available current surplus, may be
            proposed, unless it is supported by a proposal creating an additional source of funds sufficient to cover
            the same. <br><br>Proposals creating additional sources of funds shall be prepared in the form of revenue
            bills. <br>The provisions of this section shall not be construed as impairing in any way the power of the
            Congress to enact revenue and appropriation bills, nor the authority of the President to propose special
            revenue and appropriation bills after the submission of the budget. <br><br>Section 14. <span

            of government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries; <br><br>(7) Brief description of the

            proposals, in accordance with approved priorities and guidelines. <br><br>Agencies which are not
            regionalized shall nonetheless estimate the amounts planned to be spent for each region of the country. <br><br>The
            Secretary shall identify by region the expenditure programs of the national government agencies in the
            national government budget, and release funds to national government agencies in accordance with the
            approved regional distribution of expenditures, specifying the region of destination. <br>Departments and

                style="font-style: italic;">. Budget Evaluation. </span>- Agency proposals shall be reviewed on the

            Proposed activities, whether new or ongoing, shall be evaluated using a zero-base approach and on the basis
            of (1) relationship with the approved development plan, (2) agency capability as demonstrated by past
            performance, (3) complemental role with related activities of other agencies, and (4) other similar
            criteria. The realization of savings in a given budget year and the consequent non-utilization of funds
            appropriated or released to a given agency shall not be a negative factor in the budget evaluation for a
            subsequent year. <br><br>Section 17. <span style="font-style: italic;">Foreign-Assisted Projects.</span> -

            Funds for implementation shall be budgeted and released to the line implementing agencies concerned;
            provided, that the budgets of coordinating bodies may include a lump-sum for purposes related to their

            for its own operations: provided, further, that funds budgeted for a given agency falling within the
            jurisdiction of a coordinating body, may be subject to release upon approval by the coordinating agency of

            funds showing the estimated amounts needed for each function, activity or purpose for which the funds are to
            be expended during the applicable allotment period. The form and the time of submission of the request for
            allotment showing the proposed quarterly allotments of the whole authorized appropriation for the department
            or agency, shall be prescribed by the Secretary. <br><br>(2) In the administration of the allotment system
            herein provided, each calendar year shall be divided into four quarterly allotment periods beginning,
            respectively, on the first day of January, April, July and October. In any case where the quarterly
            allotment period is found to be impractical or otherwise undesirable, the Secretary may prescribe a
            different period suited to the circumstances. <br><br>(3) Request for allotment shall be approved by the
            Secretary who shall ensure that expenditures are covered by appropriations both as to amount and purpose and
            who shall consider the probable needs of the department or agency for the remainder of the fiscal year or
            period for which the appropriation was made. <br><br>(4) At the end of every quarter, each department or
            agency shall report to the Secretary the current status of its appropriations, the cumulative allotments,
            obligations incurred or liquidated, total disbursements, unliquidated obligations and unexpended balances
            and the results of expended appropriations. <br><br>(5) Releases of funds appropriated for a given agency
            may be made to its regional offices if dictated by the need and urgency of regional activities. <br><br>(6)
            The Secretary shall have authority to modify or amend any allotment previously issued. In case he shall find
            at any time that the probable receipts from taxes or other sources of any fund will be less than anticipated
            and that as a consequence the amount available for the remainder of the term of the appropriations or for
            any allotment period will be less than the amount estimated or allotted therefor, he shall, with the
            approval of the President and after notice to the department or agency concerned, reduce the amount or
            amounts allotted so as to conform to the targeted budgetary goals. <br><br>(7) The Secretary shall maintain

            the President the year's program of expenditure for each agency of the government on the basis of authorized
            appropriations. The approved expenditure program shall constitute the basis for fund release during the
            fiscal period, subject to such policies, rules and regulations as may be approved by the President. <br><br>Section
            35. <span style="font-style: italic;">Special Budgets for Lump-Sum Appropriations.</span> - Expenditures

            annual General Appropriations Act or other Act and from any fund of the National Government, shall be made
            in accordance with a special budget to be approved by the President, which shall include but shall not be
            limited to the number of each kind of position, the designations, and the annual salary proposed for which
            an appropriation is intended. This provision shall be applicable to all revolving funds, receipts which are
            automatically made available for expenditure for certain specific purposes, aids and donations for carrying
            out certain activities, or deposits made to cover to cost of special services to be rendered to private
            parties. Unless otherwise expressly provided by law, when any Board, head of department, chief of bureau or
            office, or any other official, is authorized to appropriate, allot, distribute or spend any lump-sum
            appropriation or special, bond, trust, and other funds, such authority shall be subject to the provisions of
            this section. <br><br>In case of any lump-sum appropriation for salaries and wages of temporary and
            emergency laborers and employees, including contractual personnel, provided in any General Appropriation Act
            or other Acts, the expenditure of such appropriation shall be limited to the employment of persons paid by
            the month, by the day, or by the hour. <br><br>Section 36.<span
                style="font-style: italic;"> Cash Budgets.</span> - An operational cash budget shall be implemented to
            ensure the availability of cash resources for priority development projects and to establish a sound basis
            for determining the level, type and timing of public borrowings. The procedure, formal, accounts, and other
            details necessary for the execution, monitoring and control aspects of the system shall be determined
            jointly by the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of the Budget and the Chairman of the Commission on
            Audit. <br><br>Section 37.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Creation of Appropriation Reserves</span>. -
            The Secretary may establish reserves against appropriations to provide for contingencies and emergencies
            which may arise later in the calendar year and which would otherwise require deficiency appropriations. <br>The
            establishment of appropriation reserves shall not necessarily mean that such portion of the appropriation
            will not be made available for expenditure. Should conditions change during the fiscal year justifying the
            use of the reserve, necessary adjudgments may be made by the Secretary when requested by the department,
            official or agency concerned. <br><br>Section 38. <span style="font-style: italic;">Suspension of Expenditure of Appropriations. </span>-
            Except as otherwise provided in the General Appropriations Act and whenever in his judgment the public
            interest so requires, the President, upon notice to the head of office concerned, is authorized to suspend
            or otherwise stop further expenditure of funds allotted for any agency, or any other expenditure authorized
            in the General Appropriations Act, except for personal services appropriations used for permanent officials
            and employees. <br><br>Section 39.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Authority to Use Savings in Appropriations to Cover Deficits. </span>-
            Except as otherwise provided in the General Appropriations Act, any savings in the regular appropriations
            authorized in the General Appropriations Act for programs and projects of any department, office or agency,
            may, with the approval of the President, be used to cover a deficit in any other item of the regular
            appropriations: provided, that the creation of new positions or increase of salaries shall not be allowed to
            be funded from budgetary savings except when specifically authorized by law: provided, further, that
            whenever authorized positions are transferred from one program or project to another within the same
            department, office or agency, the corresponding amounts appropriated for personal services are also deemed
