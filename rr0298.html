                    <b>SUBJECT : REVENUE REGULATIONS NO. 02-98</b><br>
                    Implementing Republic Act No. 8424, "An Act Amending the National Internal Revenue Code, as Amended" Relative to the Withholding on Income Subject to the Expanded Withholding Tax and Final Withholding Tax, Withholding of Income Tax on Compensation, Withholding of Creditable Value-Added Tax and Other Percentage Taxes
                </p>

                <p><b>TO : All Internal Revenue Officers and Others Concerned</b></p>
            </center>

            <hr>

            <p>Pursuant to Sec. 244 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, in relation to Sections 57 to 59, Sections 78 to 83, Section 114(C) and Sections, 116 to 127 of Republic Act 8424, these regulations are hereby promulgated which shall govern the collection at source on income paid on or after January 1, 1998 and prescribing the Revised Withholding Tax Tables on compensation.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.57. Withholding of Tax at Source</b></p>

            <p><b>(A) Final Withholding Tax.</b> Under the final withholding tax system the amount of income tax withheld by the withholding agent is constituted as a full and final payment of the income tax due from the payee on the said income. The liability for payment of the tax rests primarily on the payor as a withholding agent. Thus, in case of his failure to withhold the tax or in case of under withholding, the deficiency tax shall be collected from the payor/withholding agent. The payee is not required to file an income tax return for the particular income.</p>

            <p>The finality of the withholding tax is limited only to the payee's income tax liability on the particular income. It does not extend to the payee's other tax liability on said income, such as when the said income is further subject to a percentage tax. For example, if a bank receives income subject to final withholding tax, the same shall be subject to a percentage tax.</p>

            <p><b>(B) Creditable Withholding Tax.</b> Under the creditable withholding tax system, taxes withheld on certain income payments are intended to equal or at least approximate the tax due of the payee on said income. The income recipient is still required to file an income tax return, as prescribed in Sec. 51 and Sec. 52 of the NIRC, as amended, to report the income and/or pay the difference between the tax withheld and the tax due on the income. Taxes withheld on income payments covered by the expanded withholding tax (referred to in Sec. 2.57.2 of these regulations) and compensation income (referred to in Sec. 2.78 also of these regulations) are creditable in nature.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.57.1. Income Payments Subject to Final Withholding Tax.</b> The following forms of income shall be subject to final withholding tax at the rates herein specified:</p>

            <p><b>(A) Income payments to a citizen or to a resident alien individual:</b></p>

            <ol type="1">

                <br>

                <li>Royalties on books, as well as other literary works and musical compositions - <b>Ten percent (10%).</b></li>

                <br>

                <li>Interest income received by a resident individual taxpayer from a depository bank under the Foreign Currency Deposit System - <b>Seven and one-half percent (7.5%).</b></li>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.58.5. Requirement for Deductibility.</b> Any income payment which is otherwise deductible under the Code shall be allowed as a deduction from the payor's gross income only if it is shown that the income tax required to be withheld has been paid to the Bureau in accordance with Secs. 57 and 58 of the Code. A deduction will also be allowed in the following cases where no withholding of tax was made:</p>

            <ol type="A">
                <li>The payee reported the income and the withholding agent/taxpayer pays the tax, including the interest incident to the failure to withhold the tax, and surcharges, if applicable, at the time of the original audit and investigation;</li>

            </ol>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.58.6. Tax Paid by Recipient of Income.</b> Every person who is required to withhold the tax from the compensation of an employee is liable for the payment of such tax to the BIR. Such liability stays even if the employee subsequently pays the tax. The payment of the tax by the employee does not relieve the employer from the liability for penalties and/or additions to the tax for failure to deduct and withhold within the time prescribed by law or regulations. The employer will not be relieved of his liability for payment of the tax required to be withheld unless he can show that the tax has been paid by the employee. The amount of any tax withheld/collected by the employer is a special fund in trust for the government of the Philippines.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.78. Withholding Tax on Compensation.</b> - The withholding of tax on compensation income is a method of collecting the income tax at source upon receipt of the income. It applies to all employed individuals whether citizens or aliens, deriving income from compensation for services rendered in the Philippines. The employer is constituted as the withholding agent.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.78.1. Withholding of Income Tax on Compensation Income.</b></p>

            <p><b>(A) Compensation Income Defined.</b> In general, the term "compensation" means all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer under an employer-employee relationship, unless specifically excluded by the Code. The name by which the remuneration for services is designated is immaterial. Thus, salaries, wages, emoluments and honoraria, allowances, commissions (e.g. transportation, representation, entertainment and the like); fees including director's fees, if the director is, at the same time, an employee of the employer/corporation; taxable bonuses and fringe benefits except those which are subject to the fringe benefits tax under Sec. 33 of the Code; taxable pensions and retirement pay; and other income of a similar nature constitute compensation income.</p>

            <p>The basis upon which the remuneration is paid is immaterial in determining whether the remuneration constitutes compensation. Thus, it may be paid on the basis of piece-work, or a percentage of profits; and may be paid hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or annually.</p>

            <p>Remuneration for services constitutes compensation even if the relationship of employer and employee does not exist any longer at the time when payment is made between the person in whose employ the services had been performed and the individual who performed them.</p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li><b>Compensation paid in kind.</b> - Compensation may be paid in money or in some medium other than money, as for example, stocks, bonds or other forms of property. If services are paid for in a medium other than money, the fair market value of the thing taken in payment is the amount to be included as compensation subject to withholding. If the services are rendered at a stipulated price, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, such price will be presumed to be the fair market value of the remuneration received. If a corporation transfers to its employees its own stock as remuneration for services rendered by the employee, the amount of such remuneration is the fair market value of the stock at the time the services were rendered.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Living quarters or meals.</b> - If a person receives a salary as remuneration for services rendered, and in addition thereto, living quarters or meals are provided, the value to such person of the quarters and meals so furnished shall be added to the remuneration paid for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation subject to withholding. However, if living quarters or meals are furnished to an employee for the convenience of the employer, the value thereof need not be included as part of compensation income.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Facilities and privileges of a relatively small value.</b> - Ordinarily, facilities and privileges (such as entertainment, medical services, or so called "courtesy" discounts on purchases), furnished or offered by an employer to his employees generally, are not considered as compensation subject to withholding if such facilities or privileges are of relatively small value and are offered or furnished by the employer merely as a means of promoting the health, goodwill, contentment, or efficiency of his employees. Where compensation is paid in property other than money, the employer shall make necessary arrangements to ensure that the amount of the tax required to be withheld is available for payment to the Commissioner.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Tips and gratuities.</b> - Tips or gratuities paid directly to an employee by a customer of the employer which are not accounted for by the employee to the employer are considered as taxable income but not subject to withholding.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Pensions, retirement and separation pay.</b> Pensions, retirement and separation pay constitute compensation subject to withholding, except those provided under Subsection B of this section.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Fixed or variable transportation, representation and other allowances</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><b>IN GENERAL</b>, fixed or variable transportation, representation and other allowances which are received by a public officer or employee or officer or employee of a private entity, in addition to the regular compensation fixed for his position or office, is compensation subject to withholding.</li>
                        <li>Any amount paid specifically, either as advances or reimbursements for travelling, representation and other bonafide ordinary and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the employee in the performance of his duties are not compensation subject to withholding, if the following conditions are satisfied:
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>It is for ordinary and necessary travelling and representation or entertainment expenses paid or incurred by the employee in the pursuit of the trade, business or profession; and</li>
                                <li>The employee is required to account/liquidate for the foregoing expenses in accordance with the specific requirements of substantiation for each category of expenses pursuant to Sec. 34 of the Code. The excess of actual expenses over advances made shall constitute taxable income if such amount is not returned to the employer. Reasonable amounts of reimbursements/ advances for travelling and entertainment expenses which are pre-computed on a daily basis and are paid to an employee while he is on an assignment or duty need not be subject to the requirement of substantiation and to withholding.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Vacation and sick leave allowances.</b> - Amounts of "vacation allowances or sick leave credits" which are paid to an employee constitute compensation. Thus, the salary of an employee on vacation or on sick leave, which are paid notwithstanding his absence from work, constitutes compensation. However, the monetized value of unutilized vacation leave credits of ten (10) days or less which were paid to the employee during the year are not subject to income tax and to the withholding tax.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Deductions made by employer from compensation of employee.</b> - Any amount which is required by law to be deducted by the employer from the compensation of an employee including the withheld tax is considered as part of the employee's compensation and is deemed to be paid to the employee as compensation at the time the deduction is made.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Remuneration for services as employee of a nonresident alien individual or foreign entity.</b> The term "compensation" includes remuneration for services performed by an employee of a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership or foreign corporation, whether or not such alien individual or foreign entity is engaged in trade or business within the Philippines. Any person paying compensation on behalf of a non-resident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation which is not engaged in trade or business within the Philippines is subject to all provisions of law and regulations applicable to an employer.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Compensation for services performed outside the Philippines.</b> Remuneration for services performed outside the Philippines by a resident citizen for a domestic or a resident foreign corporation or partnership, or for a non-resident corporation or partnership, or for a non-resident individual not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines shall be treated as compensation which is subject to tax. A non-resident citizen as defined in these regulations is taxable only on income derived from sources within the Philippines. In general, the situs of the income whether within or without the Philippines, is determined by the place where the service is rendered.</li>

The phrase "for any cause beyond the control of the said official or employee" connotes involuntariness on the part of the official or employee. The separation from the service of the official or employee must not be asked for or initiated by him. The separation was not of his own making. Whether or not the separation is beyond the control of the official or employee, being essentially a question of fact, shall be determined on the basis of prevailing facts and circumstances. It shall be duly established by the employer by competent evidence which should be attached to the monthly return for the period in which the amount paid due to the involuntary separation was made. Amounts received by reason of involuntary separation remain exempt from income tax even if the official or the employee, at the time of separation, had rendered less than ten (10) years of service and/or is below fifty (50) years of age. Any payment made by an employer to an employee on account of dismissal, constitutes compensation regardless of whether the employer is legally bound by contract, statute, or otherwise, to make such payment.</li>

                                <li>The raising or harvesting of any other agricultural or horticultural commodity. The term "farm" as used in this subsection includes, but is not limited to stock, dairy, poultry, fruits and truck farms, plantations, ranches, nurseries ranges, orchards, and such greenhouse and other similar structures as are used primarily for the raising of agricultural or horticultural commodities.</li>
                            </ol>

                        <li>The remuneration paid entirely in products of the farm where labor is performed for the following services in the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of one or more farms is not considered as remuneration for agricultural labor, provided the major part of such services is performed on a farm:

                            The services described in (i) above may include for example, services performed by carpenters, painters, mechanics, farm supervisors, irrigation engineers, bookkeepers, and other skilled or semi-skilled workers, which contribute in any way to the conduct of the farm or farms, as such, operated by the person employing them, as distinguished from any other enterprise in which such person may be engaged. Since the services described in this paragraph must be performed in the employ of the owner or tenant or other operator of the farm, the exception does not extend to remuneration paid for services performed by employees of a commercial painting concern, for example, which contracts with a farmer to renovate his farm properties.
                        </li>
                        <li>Remuneration paid entirely in products of the farm where labor is performed by an employee in the employ of any person in connection with any of the following operations is not considered as remuneration for agricultural labor without regard to the place where such services are performed:

                <br>

                <li><b>Remuneration for domestic services.</b> Remuneration paid for services of a household nature performed by an employee in or about the private home of the person by whom he is employed is not subject to withholding. However, the services of household personnel furnished to an employee (except rank and file employees) by an employer shall be subject to the fringe benefits tax pursuant to Sec. 33 of the Code, as amended. A private home is the fixed place of abode of an individual or family. If the home is utilized primarily for the purpose of supplying board or lodging to the public as a business enterprise, it ceases to be a private home and remuneration paid for services performed therein is not exempted. In general, services of a household nature in or about a private home include services rendered by cooks, maids, butlers, valets, laundresses, gardeners, chauffeurs of automobiles for family use. The remuneration paid for the services above enumerated which are performed in or about rooming or lodging houses, boarding houses, clubs, hotels, hospitals or commercial offices or establishments is considered as compensation; Remuneration paid for services performed as a private secretary, even if they are performed in the employer's home is considered as compensation;</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Remuneration for casual labor not in the course of an employer's trade or business.</b> The term "casual labor" includes labor which is occasional, incidental or regular. The expression "not in the course of the employer's trade or business" includes labor that does not promote or advance the trade or business of the employer. Thus, any remuneration paid for labor which is occasional, incidental or irregular, and does not promote or advance the employer's trade or business, is not considered as compensation.
                    <br><br>
                    EXAMPLE: A's business is that of operating a sawmill. He employs B, a carpenter, at an hourly wage to repair his home. B's work is irregular and he spends, the greater part of two days in completing the work. Since B's labor is casual and is not in the course of A's business, the remuneration paid for such services is exempted.
                    <br><br>
                    Any remuneration paid for casual labor, that is, labor which is occasional, incidental or irregular, but which is rendered in the course of the employer's trade or business, is considered as compensation.
                    <br><br>
                    EXAMPLE: E is engaged in the business of operating a department store. He employs additional clerks for a short period. While the services of the clerks may be casual, they are rendered in the course of the employer's trade or business and therefore the remuneration paid for such services is considered as compensation.
                    <br><br>
                    Any remuneration paid for casual labor performed for a corporation is considered as compensation;
                </li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Compensation for services by a citizen or resident of the Philippines for a foreign government or an international organization.</b> Remuneration paid for services performed as an employee of a foreign government or an international organization is exempted. The exemption includes not only remuneration paid for services performed by ambassadors, ministers and other diplomatic officers and employees but also remuneration paid for services performed as consular or other officer or employee of a foreign government or as a non-diplomatic representative of such government.</li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Damages.</b> Actual, moral, exemplary and nominal damages received by an employee or his heirs pursuant to a final judgment or compromise agreement arising out of or related to an employer-employee relationship.</li>

                <li><b>Life Insurance.</b> - The proceeds of life insurance policies paid to the heirs or beneficiaries upon the death of the insured, whether in a single sum or otherwise, provided however, that interest payments agreed under the policy for the amounts which are held by the insured under such an agreement shall be included in the gross income.</li>

                    </ol>
                    The above stated exclusions (a) and (b) shall cover benefits paid or accrued during the year provided that the total amount shall not exceed thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.00) which may be increased through rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, after considering, among others, the effect on the same of the inflation rate at the end of the taxable year.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li><b>GSIS, SSS, Medicare and other contributions.</b> - GSIS, SSS, Medicare and Pag-Ibig contributions, and union dues of individual employees.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.78.2. Payroll Period.</b> The term "payroll period" means the period of services for which a payment of compensation is ordinarily made to an employee by his employer. It is immaterial that the compensation is not always paid at regular intervals.</p>

            <p>EXAMPLE: if an employer ordinarily pays the weekly wages of his employees at the end of the week, but if for some reason a particular employee receives payment of his salaries for the past week in the middle of the current week and receives the remainder at the end of the same week, the payroll period is still the calendar week; or if, instead, the employee is sent on a three (3)-week trip by his employer and receives at the end of the trip a single compensation payment for three (3)-week services, the payroll period is still the calendar week, and the compensation payment shall be treated as though it were three (3) separate weekly compensation payments.</p>

            <p>For the purpose of determining the tax, an employee can have but one payroll period with respect to the compensation paid by any one employer. Thus, if an employee is paid a regular compensation for the weekly payroll and in addition thereto is paid supplemental compensation (for example taxable bonuses) determined with respect to a different period, the payroll period is the weekly payroll period.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.78.3. Employee.</b> The term "employee" is an individual performing services under an employer-employee relationship. The term covers all employees, including officers and employees, whether elected or appointed, of the Government of the Philippines, or any political subdivision thereof or any agency or instrumentality.</p>

            <p>In general, the relationship of the employer and employee exists when the person for whom services were performed has the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which the result is accomplished. An employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done, but how it shall be done. In this connection, it is not necessary that the employer actually directs or controls the manner in which the services are performed. It is sufficient that he has the right to do so.</p>

            <p>The right to dismiss an employee is also an important factor indicating that the person possessing that right is an employer. Other factors or characteristics of an employer, which may not be necessarily present in every case, are furnishing the tools and furnishing of a place to work, to the individual who performs the services. In general, an individual is not considered an employee if he is subject to the control or direction of another merely on to the result to be accomplished by the work, and not on to the means and methods for accomplishing the result.</p>

            <p>In general, individuals who follow an independent trade, business, or profession, in which the offer their services to the public, are not employees. The measurement, method or designation of compensation is also immaterial if the relationship of employer and employee in fact exists.</p>

            <p>No distinction is made between classes or grades of employees. Thus superintendents, managers, and others belonging to similar levels are employees. An officer of a corporation is an employee of the corporation. An individual, performing services for a corporation, both as an officer and director, is an employee subject to withholding on compensation, including director's fees.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.78.4. Employer.</b> The term employer means any person for whom an individual performs or performed any service, of whatever nature, under an employer-employee relationship. It is not necessary that the services be continuing at the time the wages are paid in order that the status of employer may exist. Thus for purposes of withholding, a person for whom an individual has performed past services and from whom he is still receiving compensation is an "employee".</p>

            <p><b>(A) Person for whom the services are or were performed does not have control.</b> The term "employer" also refers to the person having control of the payment of the compensation in cases where the services are or were performed for a person who does not exercise such control. For example, where compensation, such as certain types of pensions or retirement pay, are paid by a trust and the person for whom the services were performed has no control over the payment of such compensation, the trust is deemed to be the "employer".</p>

            <p><b>(B) Person paying compensation on behalf of a nonresident.</b> The term "employer" also means any person paying compensation on behalf of a non-resident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation, who is not engaged in trade or business within the Philippines.</p>

            <p>It is the responsibility of the employer to withhold, pay, or refund the tax and furnish the statements required under these Regulations. The term "employer" as defined in (A) and (B) above is intended to determine who is the withholding agent.</p>

            <p>As a matter of business administration, certain mechanical details of the withholding process may be handled by representatives of the employer. Thus, in the case of a corporate employer with branch offices, the branch manager or other representative may actually, as a matter of internal administration, withhold the tax or prepare the statements required under the law. Nevertheless, the legal responsibility for withholding, paying and returning the tax and furnishing such statements rests with the corporate employer.</p>

            <p>An employer may be an individual, a corporation, a partnership, a trust, an estate, a joint-stock company, an association, or a syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated organization, group or entity. A trust or estate, rather than the fiduciary acting for or on behalf of the trust or estate, is generally the employer.</p>

            <p>The term "employer" embraces not only an individual and an organization engaged in trade or business, but it also includes an organization exempt from income tax, such as charitable and religious organizations, clubs, social organizations and societes, as well as the Government of the Philippines, including its agencies, instrumentalities, and political subdivisions.</p>

            <p><b>(C) Compensation paid on behalf of two or more employers.</b> If a payment of compensation is made to an employee by an employer through an agent, fiduciary, or other person who has the control, receipt, custody, or disposal of, or pays the compensation payable by another employer to such employee, the amount of tax required to be withheld on each compensation payment made through such agent, fiduciary, or person shall, whether the compensation is paid separately on behalf of each employer or paid in lump-sum on behalf of all such employers, be determined based on the aggregate amount of such compensation payment or payments in the same manner as if such aggregate amount had been paid by one employer. Hence, the tax shall be determined based on the aggregate amount of the compensation paid.</p>

            <p>In any such case, each employer shall be liable for the return and payment of a pro-rata portion of the tax so determined in accordance with the ratio of the amount contributed by each employer relative to the aggregate of such compensation.</p>

            <p>A fiduciary, agent, or other person acting for two or more employers may be authorized to withhold the tax under these regulations with respect to the wages of the employees of such employers. Such fiduciary, agent, or other person may also be authorized to make and file returns of the tax withheld at source on such compensation and to furnish the receipts required under these Regulations. Application for the authorization to perform such act should be addressed to the Commissioner or his duly authorized representative. If such authority is granted by the Commissioner, all provisions of the law (including penalties) and regulations prescribed in pursuance of the law applicable in respect of an employer for whom such fiduciary, agent or other person acts shall remain subject to all provisions of law (including penalties) and regulations prescribed in pursuance of the law applicable in respect of employers.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 2.79. Income Tax Collected at Source on Compensation Income.</b></p>

            <p><b>(A) Requirement of Withholding.</b> Every employer must withhold from compensations paid, an amount computed in accordance with these regulations. Provided, that no withholding of tax shall be required where the total compensation income of an individual does not exceed the statutory minimum wage or five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) monthly (sixty thousand pesos (P60,000.00) a year), whichever is higher.</p>

            <p>Employees whose total annual compensation, as determined in the preceding paragraph, does not exceed P60,000.00 shall be given two options with which to pay his income tax due to wit:</p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li>His compensation income shall be subjected to withholding tax, but he shall not be required to file the income tax return prescribed in Sec. 51 of the Code (filing of an individual return) except when covered by any of the situations enumerated in Sec. 2.83.4 of these Regulations.</li>
                <li>His compensation income shall not be subject to a withholding tax but he shall file his annual income tax return and pay the tax due thereon, annually.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Where the employee has opted to have his compensation income subjected to withholding so as to be relieved of the obligation of filing an annual income tax return and paying his tax due on a lump sum basis, he shall execute a waiver in a prescribed BIR form of his exemption from withholding which shall constitute the authority for the employer to apply the withholding tax table provided under these Regulations. The employee who opts to file the Income Tax Return shall file the same not later than April 15 of the year immediately following the taxable year.</p>

            <p><b>(B) Computation of Withholding Tax on Compensation Income in General.</b> The procedures provided herein below shall govern the computation of withholding tax on the taxable compensation income of the employees. Provided, however, that taxable fringe benefits received by employees other than the rank and file, as defined in the Labor Code of the Philippines, as amended, shall be subject to a Fringe Benefits Tax, instead of the rates prescribed in the Withholding Tax Tables pursuant to Sec. 24(A) of the Code, as amended (refer to Sec. 2.79.D of these Regulations).</p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li><b>Use of Withholding Tax Tables.</b> In general, every employer making payment of compensation shall deduct and withhold from such compensation a tax determined in accordance with the prescribed new withholding tax tables effective January 1, 1998 (Annex A) of these Regulations. There are four (4) withholding tables prescribed in these regulations, as follows:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><b>Monthly Tax Table</b> to be used by employers using the monthly payroll period;</li>
                        <li><b>Semi-Monthly Tax Table</b> to be used by employers using the semi-monthly payroll period;</li>
                        <li><b>Weekly Tax Table</b> to be used by employers using the weekly payroll period;</li>
                        <li><b>Daily Tax Table</b> to be used by employers using the daily payroll period.</li>
                    </ol>
                    If the compensation is paid other than daily, weekly, semi-monthly or monthly, the tax to be withheld shall be computed as follows:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Annually use the annualized computation referred to in Sec. 2.79 (B)(5)(b) of these Regulations;</li>
                        <li>Quarterly and semi-annually divide the compensation by three (3) or six (6), respectively, to determine the average monthly compensation. Use the monthly withholding tax table to compute the tax, and the tax so computed shall be multiplied by three (3) or six (6) accordingly.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <br>

                <li><b>Components of the Withholding Tax Table.</b>
                    <br>
                    Each tax table is grouped into Tables A, B and C.
                    <br>
                    <b>A Table</b> for employees without dependent children

                    The columns in the Tables reflect the following:
                    <br>
                    1st column - reflects the exemption status of employee represented by letter symbols. (refer to the explanation of the legend of symbols in letter (d) below)
                    <br>
                    2nd column reflects the total amount of personal and additional exemption, in pesos, to which an employee is entitled.
                    <br>
                    Column numbers 1 to 10 reflect the portion of the amount of taxes to be withheld on the amount of compensation of the employees. Every amount in all the columns within Tables A, B and C represent the compensation level.
                    <br>
                    <b>Legend of symbols</b> - The symbols used in the new withholding tax table represent the following:
                    <br>
                    <b>Z</b> - Zero exemption for (a) employee with multiple employers simultaneously, with respect to second, third, etc., employer and (b) for employee who fails to file an application for registration (BIR Form 1902) or an exemption certificate; (BIR Form 2305)
                    <br>
                    <b>S</b> - Single, legally separated spouses/widow/widower without any qualified dependent;
                    <br>
                    <b>ME</b> - Married employee who is not legally separated;
                    <br>
                    <b>HF</b> - Head of the family who is either single/legally separated spouse/widow or widower with a qualified dependent parent; sister or brother; legitimate, recognized natural or legally adopted child; or a qualified senior citizen as defined by these regulations pursuant to Sec. 2 of R.A. No. 7432.
                    <br>
                    In view however, of the promulgation of the Family Code which makes no distinction between the spurious and natural child, an illegitimate child can now be considered as a qualified dependent and qualifies the claimant to the status of head of the family.
                    <br>
                    The numerals (1-4) affixed to the status symbols "ME" and HF" represent the number of qualified legitimate, illegitimate, or legally adopted children;
                    <br>
                    Exemption means the amount of exemption in thousand pesos an employee is entitled to claim as a deduction from gross compensation income in accordance with the status and number of qualified dependent children.

                <br>

                <li><b>Steps to determine the amount of tax to be withheld:</b>
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 1.</b> Use the appropriate tables for the payroll period; monthly semi-monthly weekly or daily as the case may be.
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 2.</b> Determine the total monetary and non-monetary compensation paid to an employee for the payroll period, segregating gross benefits which includes thirteenth (13th) month pay, productivity incentives, Christmas bonus, and other benefits received by the employee per payroll period. Gross benefits which are received by officials and employees of public and private entities in the amount of thirty thousand pesos (P30,000) or less shall be exempted from income tax and from withholding tax.
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 3.</b> Segregate the taxable compensation from the non-taxable income paid to the employee for the payroll period. The taxable income refers to all remuneration paid to an employee not otherwise exempted by law from income tax and consequently from withholding tax. The non-taxable income are those which are specifically exempted from income tax by the Code or by other special laws as listed in Sec. 2.78.1 (B) of these Regulations (e.g. benefits not exceeding P30,000, non-taxable retirement benefits and separation pay).
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 4.</b> Segregate the taxable compensation income as determined in Step 3 into regular taxable compensation income and supplementary compensation income. Regular compensation includes basic salary, fixed allowances for representation, transportation and other allowances paid to an employee per payroll period. Supplementary compensation includes payments to an employee in addition to the regular compensation such as commission, overtime pay, taxable retirement pay, taxable bonus and other taxable benefits, with or without regard to a payroll period.
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 5.</b> Fix the compensation level as follows:
                    <br>
                    (i) Determine the line (horizontal) corresponding to the status and number of qualified dependent children using the appropriate symbol for the taxpayer status.
                    <br>
                    (ii) Determine the column to be used by taking into account only the total amount of taxable regular compensation income. The compensation level is the amount indicated in the line and column to which the regular compensation income is equal to or in excess, but not to exceed the amount in the next column of the same line.
                    <br>
                    <b>Step 6.</b> Compute the withholding tax due by adding the tax predetermined in the compensation level indicated at the top of the column, to the tax on the excess of the total regular and supplementary compensation over the compensation level, which is computed by multiplying the excess by the rate also indicated at the top of the same column.
                </li>

For purposes of substantiating the claim of insurance expense, the policy contract shall be presented to the employer together with the original official receipt of the premium payment, in addition to the documents which will be prescribed by the BIR in a separate regulation to determine the aggregate of his family income. Total family income includes primary income and other income from sources received by all members of the nuclear family, i.e. father, mother, unmarried children living together as one household, or a single parent with children. A single person living alone is considered as a nuclear family.

The deficiency tax (when the amount of tax computed in Step 5 is greater than the amount of cumulative tax already deducted and withheld or when no tax has been withheld from the beginning of the calendar year) shall be deducted from the last payment of compensation for the calendar year. If the deficiency tax is more than the amount of last compensation to be paid to an employee, the employer shall be liable to pay the amount of tax which cannot be collected from the employee.

In return, the employer is entitled to deduct the amount refunded from the remittable amount of taxes withheld from compensation income in the current month in which the refund was made, and in the succeeding months thereafter until the amount refunded by the employer is fully repaid.

            <p><b>SECTION 2.83.6. Applicability of Constructive Receipt of Compensation.</b> The withholding tax on compensation shall apply to compensation actually or constructively paid. Compensation is constructively paid within the meaning of these Regulations when it is credited to the account of or set apart for an employee so that it may be drawn upon by him at any time although not then actually reduced to possession.

If the income is not credited, but it is set apart, such income must be unqualifiedly subject to the demand of the taxpayer.
