                the rules and regulations on the mandatory drug testing of candidates for public office in connection
                with the May 10, 2004 synchronized national and local elections. The pertinent portions of the said
                resolution read as follows:<br>
                <blockquote>WHEREAS, Section 36 (g) of Republic Act No. 9165 provides:<br><br>SEC. 36. <i>Authorized

                    supplied.)<br></blockquote>
                Petitioner Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr., a senator of the Republic and a candidate for re-election in the
                May 10, 2004 elections,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed a Petition for Certiorari and
                Prohibition under Rule 65.&nbsp; In it, he seeks (1) to nullify Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165 and COMELEC
                Resolution No. 6486 dated December 23, 2003 for being unconstitutional in that they impose a
                qualification for candidates for senators in addition to those already provided for in the 1987
                Constitution; and (2) to enjoin the COMELEC from implementing Resolution No. 6486.<br><br>Pimentel
                invokes as legal basis for his petition Sec. 3, Article VI of the Constitution, which states:<br>
                <blockquote>SECTION 3. No person shall be a Senator unless he is a natural-born citizen of the
                    Philippines, and, on the day of the election, is at least thirty-five years of age, able to read and
                    write, a registered voter, and a resident of the Philippines for not less than two years immediately
                    preceding the day of the election.<br></blockquote>
                According to Pimentel, the Constitution only prescribes a maximum of five (5) qualifications for one to
                be a candidate for, elected to, and be a member of the Senate.&nbsp; He says that both the Congress and
                COMELEC, by requiring, via RA 9165 and Resolution No. 6486, a senatorial aspirant, among other
                candidates, to undergo a mandatory drug test, create an additional qualification that all candidates for
                senator must first be certified as drug free. He adds that there is no provision in the Constitution
                authorizing the Congress or COMELEC to expand the qualification requirements of candidates for
                senator.<br>
                <center><br><b>G.R. No.<i> </i>157870</b> (<i>Social Justice Society v. Dangerous</i><br><i>Drugs Board
                    and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency</i>)<br></center>
                <br>In its Petition for Prohibition under Rule 65, petitioner Social Justice Society (SJS), a&nbsp;
                registered political party, seeks to prohibit the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) and the Philippine Drug
                Enforcement Agency (PDEA) from enforcing paragraphs (c), (d), (f), and (g) of Sec. 36 of RA 9165 on the
                ground that they are constitutionally infirm. For one, the provisions constitute undue delegation of
                legislative power when they give unbridled discretion to schools and employers to determine the manner
                of drug testing.&nbsp; For another, the provisions trench in the equal protection clause inasmuch as
                they can be used to harass a student or an employee deemed undesirable.&nbsp; And for a third, a
                person's constitutional right against unreasonable searches is also breached by said provisions.<br><br>
                <center><b>G.R. No. 158633</b><i> </i>(<i>Atty. Manuel J. Laserna, Jr. v. Dangerous <br>Drugs Board and
                    Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency</i>)<br></center>
                <br>Petitioner Atty. Manuel J. Laserna, Jr., as citizen and taxpayer, also seeks in his Petition for
                Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65 that Sec. 36(c), (d), (f), and (g) of RA 9165 be struck down as
                unconstitutional for infringing on the constitutional right to privacy, the right against unreasonable
                search and seizure, and the right against self-incrimination, and for being contrary to the due process
                and equal protection guarantees.<br>
                <center><br><b>The Issue on <i>Locus Standi</i></b><br></center>
                <br>First off, we shall address the justiciability of the cases at bench and the matter of the standing
                of petitioners SJS and Laserna to sue. As respondents DDB and PDEA assert, SJS and Laserna failed to
                allege any incident amounting to a violation of the constitutional rights mentioned in their separate
                petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>It is basic that the power of judicial
                review can only be exercised in connection with a <i>bona fide</i> controversy which involves the
                statute sought to be reviewed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; But even with the
                presence of an actual case or controversy, the Court may refuse to exercise judicial review unless the
                constitutional question is brought before it by a party having the requisite standing to challenge
                it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]&nbsp; </sup>To have standing, one must establish that he or
                she has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the allegedly illegal conduct of the
                government; the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action; and the injury is likely to be
                redressed by a favorable action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The rule on
                standing, however, is a matter of procedure; hence, it can be relaxed for non-traditional plaintiffs,
                like ordinary citizens, taxpayers, and legislators when the public interest so requires, such as when
                the matter is of transcendental importance, of overarching significance to society, or of paramount
                public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; There is no doubt that Pimentel, as
                senator of the Philippines and candidate for the May 10, 2004 elections, possesses the requisite
                standing since he has substantial interests in the subject matter of the petition, among other
                preliminary considerations.&nbsp; Regarding SJS and Laserna, this Court is wont to relax the rule on <i>locus
                    standi</i> owing primarily to the transcendental importance and the paramount public interest
                involved in the enforcement of Sec. 36 of RA 9165.<br><br>
                <center><b>The Consolidated Issues</b><br></center>
                <br>The principal issues before us are as follows:<br><br>(1) Do Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165 and COMELEC
                Resolution No. 6486 impose an additional qualification for candidates for senator? Corollarily, can
                Congress enact a law prescribing qualifications for candidates for senator in addition to those laid
                down by the Constitution? and<br><br>(2) Are paragraphs (c), (d), (f), and (g) of Sec. 36, RA 9165
                unconstitutional? Specifically, do these paragraphs violate the right to privacy, the right against
                unreasonable searches and seizure, and the equal protection clause? Or do they constitute undue
                delegation of legislative power?<br><br>
                <center><b>Pimentel Petition </b><br><b>(Constitutionality of Sec. 36[g] of RA 9165 and </b><br><b>COMELEC
                    Resolution No. 6486)</b><br></center>
                <br>In essence, Pimentel claims that Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165 and COMELEC Resolution No. 6486 illegally
                impose an additional qualification on candidates for senator. He points out that, subject to the
                provisions on nuisance candidates, a candidate for senator needs only to meet the qualifications laid
                down in Sec. 3, Art. VI of the Constitution, to wit: (1) citizenship, (2) voter registration, (3)
                literacy, (4) age, and (5) residency.&nbsp; Beyond these stated qualification requirements, candidates
                for senator need not possess any other qualification to run for senator and be voted upon and elected as
                member of the Senate. The Congress cannot validly amend or otherwise modify these qualification
                standards, as it cannot disregard, evade, or weaken the force of a constitutional mandate,<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> or alter or enlarge the Constitution.<br><br>Pimentel's
                contention is well-taken.&nbsp; Accordingly, Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165 should be, as it is hereby declared
                as, unconstitutional. It is basic that if a law or an administrative rule violates any norm of the
                Constitution, that issuance is null and void and has no effect. The Constitution is the basic law to
                which all laws must conform; no act shall be valid if it conflicts with the Constitution.<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In the discharge of their defined functions, the three
                departments of government have no choice but to yield obedience to the commands of the Constitution.&nbsp;
                Whatever limits it imposes must be observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><br><br>Congress'
                inherent legislative powers, broad as they may be, are subject to certain limitations.&nbsp; As early as
                1927, in <i>Government v. Springer</i>, the Court has defined, in the abstract, the limits on
                legislative power in the following wise:<br>
                <blockquote>Someone has said that the powers of the legislative department of the Government, like the
                    boundaries of the ocean, are unlimited. In constitutional governments, however, as well as
                    governments acting under delegated authority, the powers of each of the departments x x x are
                    limited and confined within the four walls of the constitution or the charter, and each department
                    can only exercise such powers as are necessarily implied from the given powers.&nbsp; The
                    Constitution is the shore of legislative authority against which the waves of legislative enactment
                    may dash, but over which it cannot leap.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br>
                </blockquote>
                Thus, legislative power remains limited in the sense that it is subject to substantive and
                constitutional limitations which circumscribe both the exercise of the power itself and the allowable
                subjects of legislation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; The substantive
                constitutional limitations are chiefly found in the Bill of Rights<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
                and other provisions, such as Sec. 3, Art. VI of the Constitution prescribing the qualifications of
                candidates for senators.<br><br>In the same vein, the COMELEC cannot, in the guise of enforcing and
                administering election laws or promulgating rules and regulations to implement Sec. 36(g), validly
                impose qualifications on candidates for senator in addition to what the Constitution prescribes. If
                Congress cannot require a candidate for senator to meet such additional qualification, the COMELEC, to
                be sure, is also without such power. The right of a citizen in the democratic process of election should
                not be defeated by unwarranted impositions of requirement not otherwise specified in the
                Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165, as sought to
                be implemented by the assailed COMELEC resolution, effectively enlarges the qualification requirements
                enumerated in the Sec. 3, Art. VI of the Constitution.&nbsp; As couched, said Sec. 36(g) unmistakably
                requires a candidate for senator to be certified illegal-drug clean, obviously as a pre-condition to the
                validity of a certificate of candidacy for senator or, with like effect, a condition <i>sine qua non</i>
                to be voted upon and, if proper, be proclaimed as senator-elect. The COMELEC resolution completes the
                chain with the proviso that "[n]o person elected to any public office shall enter upon the duties of his
                office until he has undergone mandatory drug test."&nbsp; Viewed, therefore, in its proper context, Sec.
                36(g) of RA 9165 and the implementing COMELEC Resolution add another qualification layer to what the
                1987 Constitution, at the minimum, requires for membership in the Senate. Whether or not the drug-free
                bar set up under the challenged provision is to be hurdled before or after election is really of no
                moment, as getting elected would be of little value if one cannot assume office for non-compliance with
                the drug-testing requirement.<br><br>It may of course be argued, in defense of the validity of Sec.
                36(g) of RA 9165, that the provision does not expressly state that non-compliance with the drug test
                imposition is a disqualifying factor or would work to nullify a certificate of candidacy. This argument
                may be accorded plausibility if the drug test requirement is optional. But the particular section of the
                law, without exception, made drug-testing on those covered mandatory, necessarily suggesting that the
                obstinate ones shall have to suffer the adverse consequences for not adhering to the statutory command.
                And since the provision deals with candidates for public office, it stands to reason that the adverse
                consequence adverted to can only refer to and revolve around the election and the assumption of public
                office of the candidates. Any other construal would reduce the mandatory nature of Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165
                into a pure jargon without meaning and effect whatsoever.<br><br>While it is anti-climactic to state it
                at this juncture, COMELEC Resolution No. 6486 is no longer enforceable, for by its terms, it was
                intended to cover only the May 10, 2004 synchronized elections and the candidates running in that
                electoral event. Nonetheless, to obviate repetition, the Court deems it appropriate to review and rule,
                as it hereby rules, on its validity as an implementing issuance.<br><br>It ought to be made abundantly
                clear, however, that the unconstitutionality of Sec. 36(g) of RA 9165 is rooted on its having infringed
                the constitutional provision defining the qualification or eligibility requirements for one aspiring to
                run for and serve as senator.<br>

                students and public and private employees, while mandatory, is a random and suspicionless arrangement.

                purpose, per the policy-declaration portion of the law, can be achieved via the pursuit by the state of
                "an intensive and unrelenting campaign against the trafficking and use of dangerous drugs x x x through

                illegal drug user consent to undergo rehabilitation.&nbsp; Secs. 54 and 55 of RA 9165 are clear on this

                School children, the US Supreme Court noted, are most vulnerable to the physical, psychological, and
                addictive effects of drugs. Maturing nervous systems of the young are more critically impaired by
                intoxicants and are more inclined to drug dependency. Their recovery is also at a depressingly low rate.<sup

                has long come into its own, this case appears to be the first time that the validity of a state-decreed
                search or intrusion through the medium of mandatory random drug testing among students and employees is,
                in this jurisdiction, made the focal point.&nbsp; Thus, the issue tendered in these proceedings is
                veritably one of first impression.<br><br>US jurisprudence is, however, a rich source of persuasive
                jurisprudence. With respect to random drug testing among school children, we turn to the teachings
                of<i> </i><i>Vernonia</i><i> </i><i>School District</i><i> 47J v. Acton </i>(<i>Vernonia</i>) and <i>Board
                    of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County</i>, <i>et al.</i> <i>v.

                both fairly pertinent US Supreme Court-decided cases involving the constitutionality of governmental
                search.<br><br>In <i>Vernonia</i>, school administrators in Vernonia, Oregon wanted to address the drug
                menace in their respective institutions following the discovery of frequent drug use by school athletes.&nbsp;
                After consultation with the parents, they required random urinalysis drug testing for the school's
                athletes.&nbsp; James Acton, a high school student, was denied participation in the football program
                after he refused to undertake the urinalysis drug testing. Acton forthwith sued, claiming that the
                school's drug testing policy violated, <i>inter alia</i>, the Fourth Amendment<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; of the US Constitution.<br><br>The US Supreme
                Court, in fashioning a solution to the issues raised in <i>Vernonia</i>, considered the following: (1)
                schools stand <i>in loco parentis</i> over their students; (2) school children, while not shedding their
                constitutional rights at the school gate, have less privacy rights; (3) athletes have less privacy
                rights than non-athletes since the former observe communal undress before and after sports events; (4)
                by joining the sports activity, the athletes voluntarily subjected themselves to a higher degree of
                school supervision and regulation; (5) requiring urine samples does not invade a student's privacy since
                a student need not undress for this kind of drug testing; and (6) there is need for the drug testing
                because of the dangerous effects of illegal drugs on the young.&nbsp; The US Supreme Court held that the
                policy constituted reasonable search under the Fourth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and
                14th Amendments and declared the random drug-testing policy constitutional.<br><br>In <i>Board of
                    Education</i>, the Board of Education of a school in Tecumseh, Oklahoma required a drug test for
                high school students desiring to join extra-curricular activities.&nbsp; Lindsay Earls, a member of the
                show choir, marching band, and academic team declined to undergo a drug test and averred that the
                drug-testing policy made to apply to non-athletes violated the Fourth and 14th Amendments. As Earls
                argued, unlike athletes who routinely undergo physical examinations and undress before their peers in
                locker rooms, non-athletes are entitled to more privacy.<br><br>The US Supreme Court, citing
                <i>Vernonia</i>, upheld the constitutionality of drug testing even among non-athletes on the basis of
                the school's custodial responsibility and authority.&nbsp; In so ruling, said court made no distinction
                between a non-athlete and an athlete.&nbsp; It ratiocinated that schools and teachers act in place of
                the parents with a similar interest and duty of safeguarding the health of the students. And in holding
                that the school could implement its random drug-testing policy, the Court hinted that such a test was a
                kind of search in which even a reasonable parent might need to engage.<br><br>In sum, what can
                reasonably be deduced from the above two cases and applied to this jurisdiction are: (1) schools and
                their administrators stand <i>in loco parentis</i> with respect to their students; (2) minor students
                have contextually fewer rights than an adult, and are subject to the custody and supervision of their
                parents, guardians, and schools; (3) schools, acting <i>in loco parentis</i>, have a duty to safeguard
                the health and well-being of their students and may adopt such measures as may reasonably be necessary
                to discharge such duty; and (4) schools have the right to impose conditions on applicants for admission
                that are fair, just, and non-discriminatory.<br><br>Guided by <i>Vernonia </i>and<i> Board of
                    Education</i>, the Court is of the view and so holds that the provisions of RA 9165 requiring
                mandatory, random, and suspicionless drug testing of students are constitutional. Indeed, it is within
                the prerogative of educational institutions to require, as a condition for admission, compliance with
                reasonable school rules and regulations and policies.&nbsp; To be sure, the right to enroll is not
                absolute; it is subject to fair, reasonable, and equitable requirements.<br><br>The Court can take
                judicial notice of the proliferation of prohibited drugs in the country that threatens the well-being of
                the people,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> particularly the youth and school children who
                usually end up as victims. Accordingly, and until a more effective method is conceptualized and put in
                motion, a random drug testing of students in secondary and tertiary schools is not only acceptable but
                may even be necessary if the safety and interest of the student population, doubtless a legitimate
                concern of the government,&nbsp; are to be promoted and protected.&nbsp; To borrow from <i>Vernonia</i>,
                "[d]eterring drug use by our Nation's schoolchildren is as important as enhancing efficient enforcement
                of the Nation's laws against the importation of drugs"; the necessity for the State to act is magnified
                by the fact that the effects of a drug-infested school are visited not just upon the users, but upon the
                entire student body and faculty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Needless to stress,
                the random testing scheme provided under the law argues against the idea that the testing aims to
                incriminate unsuspecting individual students.<br><br>Just as in the case of secondary and tertiary level
                students, the mandatory but random drug test prescribed by Sec. 36 of RA 9165 for officers and employees
                of public and private offices is justifiable, albeit not exactly for the same reason. The Court notes in
                this regard that petitioner SJS, other than saying that "subjecting almost everybody to drug testing,
                without probable cause, is unreasonable, an unwarranted intrusion of the individual right to
                privacy,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> has failed to show how the mandatory, random,
                and suspicionless drug testing under Sec. 36(c) and (d) of RA 9165 violates the right to privacy and
                constitutes unlawful and/or unconsented search under Art. III, Secs. 1 and 2 of the Constitution.<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Petitioner Laserna's lament is just as simplistic,
                sweeping, and gratuitous and does not merit serious consideration. Consider what he wrote without
                elaboration:<br>
                <blockquote>The US Supreme Court and US Circuit Courts of Appeals have made various rulings on the
                    constitutionality of mandatory drug tests in the school and the workplaces. The US courts have been
                    consistent in their rulings that the mandatory drug tests violate a citizen's constitutional right
                    to privacy and right against unreasonable search and seizure. They are quoted extensively
                    hereinbelow.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>
                The essence of privacy is the right to be left alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In
                context, the right to privacy means the right to be free from unwarranted exploitation of one's person
                or from intrusion into one's private activities in such a way as to cause humiliation to a person's
                ordinary sensibilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]&nbsp; </sup>And while there has been
                general agreement as to the basic function of the guarantee against unwarranted search, "translation of
                the abstract prohibition against `unreasonable searches and seizures' into workable broad guidelines for
                the decision of particular cases is a difficult task," to borrow from <i>C. Camara v. Municipal
                    Court</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Authorities are agreed though that
                the right to privacy&nbsp;&nbsp; yields to certain paramount rights of the public and defers to the
                state's exercise of police power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As the
                warrantless clause of Sec. 2, Art III of the Constitution is couched and as has been held,
                "reasonableness" is the touchstone of the validity of a government search or intrusion.<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> And whether a search at issue hews to the
                reasonableness standard is judged by the balancing of the government-mandated intrusion on the
                individual's privacy interest against the promotion of some compelling state interest.<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In the criminal context, reasonableness requires
                showing of probable cause to be personally determined by a judge. Given that the drug-testing policy for
                employees&#8212;and students for that matter&#8212;under RA 9165 is in the nature of administrative
                search needing what was referred to in <i>Vernonia</i> as "swift and informal disciplinary procedures,"
                the probable-cause standard is not required or even practicable. Be that as it may, the review should
                focus on the reasonableness of the challenged administrative search in question.<br><br>The first factor
                to consider in the matter of reasonableness is the nature of the privacy interest upon which the drug
                testing, which effects a search within the meaning of Sec. 2, Art. III of the Constitution, intrudes. In
                this case, the office or workplace serves as the backdrop for the analysis of the privacy expectation of
                the employees and the reasonableness of drug testing requirement. The employees' privacy interest in an
                office is to a large extent circumscribed by the company's work policies, the collective bargaining
                agreement, if any, entered into by management and the bargaining unit, and the inherent right of the
                employer to maintain discipline and efficiency in the workplace. Their privacy expectation in a
                regulated office environment is, in fine, reduced; and a degree of impingement upon such privacy has
                been upheld.<br><br>Just as defining as the first factor is the character of the intrusion authorized by
                the challenged law. Reduced to a question form, is the scope of the search or intrusion clearly set
                forth, or, as formulated in <i>Ople v. Torres</i>, is the enabling law authorizing a search "narrowly
                drawn" or "narrowly focused"?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The poser should be
                answered in the affirmative. For one, Sec. 36 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules and regulations
                (IRR), as couched, contain provisions specifically directed towards preventing a situation that would
                unduly embarrass the employees or place them under a humiliating experience. While every officer and
                employee in a private establishment is under the law deemed forewarned that he or she may be a possible
                subject of a drug test, nobody is really singled out in advance for drug testing. The goal is to
                discourage drug use by not telling in advance anyone when and who is to be tested. And as may be
                observed, Sec. 36(d) of RA 9165 itself prescribes what, in <i>Ople</i>, is a narrowing ingredient by
                providing that the employees concerned shall be subjected to "random drug test as contained in the
                company's work rules and regulations x x x for purposes of reducing the risk in the work place."<br><br>For
                another, the random drug testing shall be undertaken under conditions calculated to protect as much as
                possible the employee's privacy and dignity. As to the mechanics of the test, the law specifies that the
                procedure shall employ two testing methods, i.e., the screening test and the confirmatory test,
                doubtless to ensure as much as possible the trustworthiness of the results. But the more important
                consideration lies in the fact that the test shall be conducted by trained professionals in
                access-controlled laboratories monitored by the Department of Health (DOH) to safeguard against results
                tampering and to ensure an accurate chain of custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In
                addition, the IRR issued by the DOH provides that access to the drug results shall be on the "need to
                know" basis;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that the "drug test result and the records
                shall be [kept] confidential subject to the usual accepted practices to protect the confidentiality of
                the test results."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Notably, RA 9165 does not oblige
                the employer concerned to report to the prosecuting agencies any information or evidence relating to the
                violation of the <i>Comprehensive</i> <i>Dangerous Drugs Act</i> received as a result of the operation
                of the drug testing. All told, therefore, the intrusion into the employees' privacy, under RA 9165, is
                accompanied by proper safeguards, particularly against embarrassing leakages of test results, and is
                relatively minimal.<br><br>To reiterate, RA 9165 was enacted as a measure to stamp out illegal drug in
                the country and thus protect the well-being of the citizens, especially the youth, from the deleterious
                effects of dangerous drugs. The law intends to achieve this through the medium, among others, of
                promoting and resolutely pursuing a national drug abuse policy in the workplace via a mandatory random
                drug test.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; To the Court, the need for drug testing
                to at least minimize illegal drug use is substantial enough to override the individual's privacy
                interest under the premises.&nbsp; The Court can consider that the illegal drug menace cuts across
                gender, age group, and social- economic lines. And it may not be amiss to state that the sale,
                manufacture, or trafficking of illegal drugs, with their ready market, would be an investor's dream were
                it not for the illegal and immoral components of any of such&nbsp; activities.&nbsp; The drug problem
                has hardly abated since the martial law public execution of a notorious drug trafficker. The state can
                no longer assume a laid back stance with respect to this modern-day scourge.&nbsp; Drug enforcement
                agencies perceive a mandatory random drug test to be an effective way of preventing and deterring drug
                use among employees in private offices, the threat of detection by random testing being higher than
                other modes. The Court holds that the chosen method is a reasonable and enough means to lick the
                problem.<br><br>Taking into account the foregoing factors, i.e., the reduced expectation of privacy on
                the part of the employees, the compelling state concern likely to be met by the search, and the
                well-defined limits set forth in the law to properly guide authorities in the conduct of the random
                testing, we hold that the challenged drug test requirement is, under the limited context of the case,
                reasonable and, <i>ergo</i>, constitutional.<br><br>Like their counterparts in the private sector,
                government officials and employees also labor under reasonable supervision and restrictions imposed by
                the Civil Service law and other laws on public officers, all enacted to promote a high standard of
                ethics in the public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; And if RA 9165 passes
                the norm of reasonableness for private employees, the more reason that it should pass the test for civil
                servants, who, by constitutional command, are required to be accountable at all times to the people and
                to serve them with utmost responsibility and efficiency.<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Petitioner SJS' next posture that Sec. 36 of RA
                9165 is objectionable on the ground of undue delegation of power hardly commends itself for concurrence.&nbsp;
                Contrary to its position, the provision in question is not so extensively drawn as to give unbridled
                options to schools and employers to determine the manner of drug testing.&nbsp; Sec. 36 expressly
                provides how drug testing for students of secondary and tertiary schools and officers/employees of
                public/private offices should be conducted.&nbsp; It enumerates the persons who shall undergo drug
                testing. In the case of students, the testing shall be in accordance with the school rules as contained
                in the student handbook and with notice to parents. On the part of officers/employees, the testing shall
                take into account the company's work rules. In either case, the random procedure shall be observed,
                meaning that the persons to be subjected to drug test shall be picked by chance or in an unplanned way.
                And in all cases, safeguards against misusing and compromising the confidentiality of the test results
                are established.<br><br>Lest it be overlooked, Sec. 94 of RA 9165 charges the DDB to issue, in
                consultation with the DOH, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Education, and
                Department of Labor and Employment, among other agencies, the IRR necessary to enforce the law.&nbsp; In
                net effect then, the participation of schools and offices in the drug testing scheme shall always be
                subject to the IRR of RA 9165.&nbsp; It is, therefore, incorrect to say that schools and employers have
                unchecked discretion to determine how often, under what conditions, and where the drug tests shall be
                conducted.<br><br>The validity of delegating legislative power is now a quiet area in the constitutional
                landscape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; In the face of the increasing complexity
                of the task of the government and the increasing inability of the legislature to cope directly with the
                many problems demanding its attention, resort to delegation of power, or entrusting to administrative
                agencies the power of subordinate legislation, has become imperative, as here.<br>
                <center><br><b>Laserna Petition (Constitutionality of Sec. 36[c], [d], </b><br><b>[f], and [g] of RA
                    9165)</b><br></center>
                <br>Unlike the situation covered by Sec. 36(c) and (d) of RA 9165, the Court finds no valid
                justification for mandatory drug testing for persons accused of crimes. In the case of students, the
                constitutional viability of the mandatory, random, and suspicionless drug testing for students emanates
                primarily from the waiver by the students of their right to privacy when they seek entry to the school,
                and from their voluntarily submitting their persons to the parental authority of school authorities. In
                the case of private and public employees, the constitutional soundness of the mandatory, random, and
                suspicionless drug testing proceeds from the reasonableness of the drug test policy and requirement.<br><br>We
                find the situation entirely different in the case of persons charged before the public prosecutor's
                office with criminal offenses punishable with six (6) years and one (1) day imprisonment.&nbsp; The
                operative concepts in the mandatory drug testing are "randomness" and "suspicionless."&nbsp; In the case
                of persons charged with a crime before the prosecutor's office, a mandatory drug testing can never be
                random or suspicionless.&nbsp; The ideas of randomness and being suspicionless are antithetical to their
                being made defendants in a criminal complaint.&nbsp; They are not randomly picked; neither are they
                beyond suspicion.&nbsp; When persons suspected of committing a crime are charged, they are singled out
                and are impleaded against their will.&nbsp; The persons thus charged, by the bare fact of being haled
                before the prosecutor's office and peaceably submitting themselves to drug testing, if that be the case,
                do not necessarily consent to the procedure, let alone waive their right to privacy.<sup
                        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; To impose mandatory drug testing on the accused
                is a blatant attempt to harness a medical test as a tool for criminal prosecution, contrary to the
                stated objectives of RA 9165.&nbsp; Drug testing in this case would violate a persons' right to privacy
                guaranteed under Sec. 2, Art. III of the Constitution. Worse still, the accused persons are veritably
                forced to incriminate themselves.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court resolves to <b>GRANT</b> the
