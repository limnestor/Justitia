            <p style="text-align: justify">The person seeking to introduce an electronic data message or electronic document in any legal proceeding has the burden of proving its authenticity by evidence capable of supporting a finding that the electronic data message or electronic document is what the person claims it to be.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the integrity of the information and communication system in which an electronic data message or electronic document is recorded or stored may be established in any legal proceeding —</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">(a) By evidence that at all material times the information and communication system or other similar device was operating in a manner that did not affect the integrity of the electronic data message or electronic document, and there are no other reasonable grounds to doubt the integrity of the information and communication system;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">(b) By showing that the electronic data message or electronic document was recorded or stored by a party to the proceedings who is adverse in interest to the party using it; or</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">SECTION 12(12). <i>Admissibility and Evidential Weight of Electronic Data Messages or Electronic Documents.</i> — In any legal proceedings, nothing in the application of the rules on evidence shall deny the admissibility of an electronic data message or electronic document in evidence —</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">a. On the sole ground that it is in electronic form; or</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">b. On the ground that it is not in the standard written form, and the electronic data message or electronic document meeting, and complying with the requirements under Sections 6 or 7 hereof shall be the best evidence of the agreement and transaction contained therein.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">In assessing the evidential weight of an electronic data message or electronic document, the reliability of the manner in which it was generated, stored or communicated, the reliability of the manner in which its originator was identified, and other relevant factor shall be given due regard.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">SECTION 13(13). <i>Retention of Electronic Data Message or Electronic Document.</i> — Notwithstanding any provision of law, rule or regulation to the contrary —</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 60px">ii. Is retained in the format in which it was generated, sent or received, or in a format which can be demonstrated to accurately represent the electronic data message or electronic document generated, sent or received;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 60px">iii. Enables the identification of its originator and addressee, as well as the determination of the date and the time it was sent or received.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;padding-left: 30px">(b) The requirement referred to in paragraph (a) is satisfied by using the services of a third party, provided that the conditions set forth in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (a) are met.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">SECTION 14(14). <i>Proof by Affidavit.</i> — The matters referred to in Section 12, on admissibility and Section 9, on the presumption of integrity, may be presumed to have been established by an affidavit given to the best of the deponent&#8217;s knowledge subject to the rights of parties in interest as defined in the following section.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">SECTION 15(15). <i>Cross-Examination.</i> — (1) A deponent of an affidavit referred to in Section 14 that has been introduced in evidence may be cross-examined as of right by a party to the proceedings who is adverse in interest to the party who has introduced the affidavit or has caused the affidavit to be introduced.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">(2) Any party to the proceedings has the right to cross-examine a person referred to in Section 11, paragraph 4, sub-paragraph c.</p>
