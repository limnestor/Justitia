            term "investment" shall mean equity participation in any enterprise formed, organized or existing under the
            laws of the Philippines; and the phrase "doing business" shall include soliciting orders, purchases, service
            contracts, opening offices, whether called "liaison" offices or branches; appointing representatives or

            control of any domestic business firm, entity or corporation in the Philippines; and any other act or acts
            that imply a continuity&nbsp; of&nbsp; commercial dealings or arrangements, and contemplate to that extent
            the performance of acts or works, or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in
            progressive prosecution of, commercial gain or of the Purpose and object of the business
            organization.<br><br>(2) This Act shall not apply to banking institutions which are governed and regulated
            by the General Banking Act and other laws.<br><br>SEC. 2. <i>Permitted Investments.</i>—(1) Without need of
            prior authority anyone not a Philippine national as that term is denned in Section three of the Investment
            Incentives Act, and not otherwise disqualified by law, may invest:<br><br>
            <blockquote>(a)&nbsp; In any enterprise registered under the Investment&nbsp; Incentives Act, to the extent
                that the total investment of&nbsp; non-Philippine nationals therein would not affect its status&nbsp; as
                a registered enterprise under that law;<br><br>(b)&nbsp; In any enterprise not registered under the
                Investment Incentives Act, to the extent that the total investment&nbsp; of non-Philippine nationals
                therein shall not exceed thirty&nbsp; percent&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; outstanding&nbsp;
                capital&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; that&nbsp; enterprise,&nbsp; unless existing law forbids any non-Philippine
                ownership&nbsp; in the enterprise or limits ownership by non-Philippine&nbsp; nationals to a percentage
                smaller than thirty percent.<br><br>(2) Within thirty days after notice of the investment is received by
                it, the enterprise in which any investment is made by a non-Philippine national shall register the same
                with the Board of Investments for purposes of record. Investments made in the form of foreign exchange
                or other assets actually transferred to the Philippines shall also be registered with the Central Bank.

            registered under the Investment Incentives Act is such that the tot participation by non-Philippine
            nationals in the outstanding capital thereof shall exceed thirty percent, the enterprise must obtain prior
            authority from the Board of Investment' which&nbsp;&nbsp; authority&nbsp;&nbsp; shall&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp;
            granted&nbsp;&nbsp; unless&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; propose investment—<br><br>

                of required ownership by Philippine nationals in the enterprise; or<br><br>(b) Would pose a clear and
                present danger of promoting monopolies or combinations in restraint of trade; or<br><br>(c) Would be
                made in an enterprise engaged in an area adequately, being exploited by Philippine nationals; or<br><br>(d)
                Would conflict or be inconsistent with the Investments Priorities Plan in force at the time the
                investment is sought to be made; or<br><br>(e)&nbsp; Would not contribute to the sound and balanced
                development of the national economy on a self-sustaining basis.
            </blockquote>
            <br><br>Investments made in the form of foreign exchange or other assets actually transferred to the
            Philippines shall also be registered with the Central Bank. The Board shall assess and appraise the value of

            national, or more than thirty per cent of the outstanding capital of which is owned or controlled by aliens
            shall do business or engage in any economic activity in the Philippines or be registered, licensed, or

            subdivision or instrumentality of the government, to do business, or engage in any economic activity in the
            Philippines, without first securing a written certificate from the Board of Investments to the effect:<br>
            <blockquote>(1) That the operation or activity of such alien, firm, association, partnership, corporation or
                other form of business organization is not inconsistent with the Investments Priorities Plan;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;
                That such business or economic activity will contribute to the sound&nbsp; and balanced&nbsp;
                development of the&nbsp; national economy on a self-sustaining basis;<br><br>(3) That such business or
                economic activity by the applicant would not conflict with the Constitution or laws&nbsp; of the
                Philippines;<br><br>(4) That the field of business or economic activity is&nbsp; not one that is being
                adequately exploited by Philippine nationals; and<br><br>(5) That the entry of applicant therein will
                not pose a clear and present danger of promoting monopolies or combinations in&nbsp; restraint of trade.

                reputation, and sound financial&nbsp; standing, as resident agent, who shall be authorized to&nbsp;
                accept summons and other legal process in behalf of the applicant;<br><br>(2)&nbsp; To establish an
                office in the Philippines and to notify&nbsp; the Securities and Exchange Commission in writing of the&nbsp;

                later than ten days afterwards;<br><br>(3)&nbsp; To bring assets into the Philippines to constitute&nbsp;
                the capital of the office or offices, of such kind and value&nbsp; as the Board may deem necessary to
                protect those who&nbsp; may deal with the applicant, and to maintain that capital&nbsp; unimpaired&nbsp;
                during the&nbsp;&nbsp; period&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; does&nbsp;&nbsp; business&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;
                the&nbsp; Philippines;<br><br>(4)&nbsp; To present prior proof that citizens of the Philippines and&nbsp;
                corporations&nbsp; or&nbsp; other business&nbsp; organizations&nbsp; organized or existing under the
                laws of the Philippines are allowed to do business in the country or individual state within a federal
                country of which applicant is a citizen or in which it is domiciled: <i>Provided, however, </i>That if
                the state or country of domicile of the applicant imposes on, or requires of, Philippine nationals other
                conditions, requirements or restrictions besides those set forth in this Act, the Board of Investments
                shall impose the said other conditions, requirements or restrictions on the applicant if, in its

                on a self-sustaining basis;<br><br>(5)&nbsp; To submit to the&nbsp; Securities&nbsp; and Exchange&nbsp;
                Commission certified copies of applicant's charter and by-laws&nbsp; and all amendments thereto, if any,

                assets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

                agreement that applicant may have with a resident of the Philippines, authorizing the latter to
                assemble, manufacture or sell within the Philippines the products of the applicant, except for violation
                thereof or other just cause and upon payment of compensation and reimbursement of investment and other
                expenses incurred by the licensee in developing a market for the said products: <i>Provided,
                    however,</i> That in case of disagreement, the amount of compensation or reimbursement shall be
                determined by the court where the licensee is domiciled or has its principal office who shall require
                the applicant to file a bond in such amount as, in its opinion, is sufficient for this purpose.
            </blockquote>
            The above requirements shall be in addition to those set forth in the Corporation Law, as amended, for licensing foreign corporations and a violation of any of these requirements or of the terms and conditions which the Board may impose shall be sufficient cause to cancel a license or permit issued to this Act: Provided, however, That aliens or foreign firms, associations, partnerships, corporations or other forms of business organization not organized or existing under the laws of the Philippines who may lawfully have been licensed to do business in the Philippines prior to the effectivity of this Act shall, with respect to the activities for which they were licensed and actually engaged in prior to the effectivity of this Act, not be subject to the reporting requirements prescribed by the Board. Provided, further, That where the issuance of said license has been irregular or contrary to law, any person affected thereby may file an action with the Court of First Instance where said alien or foreign business organization resides or has its principal office to cancel the said license. In such cases, no injunction shall issue without notice and hearing; and appeals and other proceedings for review shall be filed directly with the Supreme Court.
            <br><br>SEC. 5. <i>Mergers and Consolidations.</i>—The provisions of this Act shall apply to any
            merger, consolidation, syndicate or any other combination of firms, associations, partnerships or other
            forms&nbsp; of business&nbsp; organization that will&nbsp; result in ownership or control by persons or
            entities that are not Philippine nationals of more than thirty percent of the capital of whatever
            organization results from the merger, consolidation, syndicate or other combination.<br><br>SEC. 6. <i>Local
            Government Action.</i>—No agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of the Government shall take any
            action in conflict with or which will nullify the provisions of this Act, or any certificate or authority
            granted thereunder.<br><br>SEC. 7. <i>Publication and Posting of Notices.</i>—Immediately after the filing
            of any application under this Act, the Secretary of the Board of Investments shall publish the same at the
            expense of the applicant once a week for three consecutive weeks in the <i>Official Gazette </i>and in one
            of the newspapers of general circulation in the province or city where the applicant has its principal
            office, and post copies of said application in conspicuous places, in the office of the Board of Investments
            or in the building where said office is located, setting forth in such copies the name of the applicant, the
            business in which it is engaged or proposes to engage or invest, and such other data and information as may

            circulation in the Philippines.
            <br><br>SEC. 9-A. <i>Periodic reports.</i>—The Board shall periodically check and verify compliance with the provisions of this Act, either by inspection of the books or by requiring regular reports from aliens or foreign firms, domestic enterprises with foreign investments in excess of thirty per cent (30%) and new entities licensed to do business under Section four of this Act. Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude the Board from requiring similar reports from domestic firms with foreign investments of less than thirty per cent (30%).
            <br><br>
            A summary of said reports shall be annually submitted by the Board to Congress not later than January fifteen.
