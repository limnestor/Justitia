If such arrangements are not feasible, the court may modify the Stay Order to allow the secured creditor lacking adequate protection to enforce its security claim against the debtor: <i>Provided, however,</i> That the court may deny the creditor the remedies in this paragraph if the property subject of the enforcement is required for the rehabilitation of the debtor.</p>
