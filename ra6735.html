                signed before the Election Registrar, or his designated representatives, in the presence of a
                representative of the proponent, and a representative of the regional assemblies and local legislative
                bodies concerned in a public place in the autonomous region or local government unit, as the case may
                be. Signature stations may be established in as many places as may be warranted.<br><br>(g) Upon the
                lapse of the period herein provided, the Commission on Elections, through its office in the local
                government unit concerned shall certify as to whether or not the required number of signatures has been
                obtained. Failure to obtain the required number is a defeat of the proposition.<br><br>(h) If the
                required number of signatures is obtained, the Commission shall then set a date for the initiative at
                which the proposition shall be submitted to the registered voters in the local government unit concerned
                for their approval within ninety (90) days from the date of certification by the Commission, as provided
                in subsection (g) hereof, in case of autonomous regions, sixty (60) days in case of provinces and
                cities, forty-five (45) days in case of municipalities, and thirty (30) days in case of barangays. The
                initiative shall then be held on the date set, after which the results thereof shall be certified and
                proclaimed by the Commission on Elections.<br><br>SEC. 14.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Effectivity of Local Propositions.</span>&#8212;If
                the proposition is approved by a majority of the votes cast, it shall take effect fifteen (15) days
                after certification by the Commission as if affirmative action thereon had been made by the local
                legislative body and local executive concerned. If it fails to obtain said number of votes, the
                proposition is considered defeated.<br><br>SEC. 15. <span style="font-style: italic;">Limitations on Local Initiatives</span>.&#8212;(a)

                extend only to subjects or matters which are within the legal powers of the local legislative bodies to
                enact.<br><br>(c) If at any time before the initiative is held, the local legislative body shall adopt
                in toto the proposition presented, the initiative shall be cancelled. However, those against such action
                may, if they so desire, apply for initiative in the manner herein provided.<br><br>SEC. 16. <span

                within six (6) months from the date therefrom, and may be amended, modified or repealed by the local
                legislative body within three (3) years thereafter by a vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all its
                members:<span style="font-style: italic;"> Provided, </span>however, That in case of barangays the
                period shall be one (1) year after the expiration of the first six (6) months.<br><br>SEC. 17. <span

                provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays for the approval or rejection, any ordinance or
                resolution duly enacted or approved.<br><br>Said referendum shall be held under the control and
                direction of the Commission within sixty (60) days in case of provinces and cities, forty-five (45) days
                in case of municipalities and thirty (30) days in case of barangays.<br><br>The Commission shall certify
