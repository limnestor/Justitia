                &ldquo;SANDIGANBAYAN&rdquo; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES) </strong></h3>
            <p>WHEREAS, the new Constitution declares that a public office is a public trust and ordains that public
            officers and employees shall serve with a highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency and shall remain at all times accountable to the people;</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, to attain the highest norms of official conduct required of public officers and employees, Section 5, Article XIII of the New Constitution provides for the creation of a special court to be known as <em>Sandiganbayan</em>;</p>
            <p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers in me vested by the Constitution, do hereby order and decree as follows:</p>
            <p><strong><em>Section 1. Sandiganbayan; composition; qualifications; tenure; removal; and compensation.</em></strong><em> &ndash;&ndash; </em>A special court, of the same level as the Court of Appeals and possessing all the inherent powers of a court of justice, to be known as the <em>Sandiganbayan</em> is hereby created composed of a Presiding Justice and fourteen Associate Justices who shall be appointed by the President. (<em>As amended by R.A. No. 8249</em>)</p>
            <p>No person shall be appointed Presiding Justice or Associate Justice of the <em>Sandiganbayan</em>; unless he is natural-born citizen of the Philippines, at lease 40 years of age and for at lease ten years has been a judge of a court of record or been engaged in the practice of law in the Philippines or has held office requiring admission to the bar as a pre-requisite for a like period.</p>
            <p>The Presiding Justice shall be so designated in his commission and the other Justices shall have precedence according to the dates of their respective of commission, or, when the commission of two or more of them shall bear the same date, according to the order in which their commissions have been issued by the President.</p>
            <p>The Presiding Justice and the Associate Justices shall not be removed from office except on impeachment upon the grounds and in the manner provided for in Section 2, 3 and 4 of Article XIII of the 1973 Constitution.</p>
            <p>The Presiding Justice shall receive an annual compensation of P60, 000.00 and each Associate Justice P 55, 000.00 which shall be diminished during their continuance in office. They shall have the same rank, privileges and other emoluments, be subject to the same inhibition and disqualifications, and enjoy the same retirement and other benefits as those provided for under existing laws for the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals.</p>
            <p>Whenever the salaries of the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals are increased, such increases in salaries shall be correspondingly extended to and enjoyed by the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the <em>Sandiganbayan. </em></p>
            <p>They shall hold office until they reach the age of 65 years or become incapacitated to discharge the duties of their office.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Section 2. Official Station; Place of Holding Sessions.</em></strong><em> &ndash;&ndash; </em>&nbsp;The <em>Sandiganbayan</em> shall have its principal office of the Metro Manila area and shall hold sessions thereat for the trial and determination of cases filed with it: <em>Provided, however, </em>That cases originating from the principal geographical regions of the country, that is, from Luzon, Visayas, or Mindanao, shall be heard in their respective regions of origin except only when the greater convenience of the accused and of the witnesses, or other compelling considerations require the contrary, in which instance a case originating from one geographical region: <em>Provided, further</em>, That for this purpose the presiding justice shall authorize any division or divisions of the court to hold sessions at any time and place outside Metro Manila and, where the interest of justice so requires, outside the territorial boundaries of the Philippines. &ldquo;The <em>Sandiganbayan </em>may require the services of the personnel and use of facilities of the courts or other government offices where any of the divisions is holding sessions and the personnel of such courts or offices shall be subject to the orders of the <em>Sandiganbayan. </em>(<em>As amended by R.A. NO. 8249</em>)</p>

            <p><strong><em>Section 3. Constitution of the Divisions; Quorum. â€“</em></strong> The Sandiganbayan shall sit in seven (7) divisions of
                three (3) members each.</p>

            <p>Two (2) members shall constitute a quorum for sessions in divisions: Provided, That when the required
                 quorum for the particular division cannot be had due to the legal disqualification or temporary
                incapacity of a member or a vacancy therein, the Presiding Justice may designate a member of another
                division to be determined by strict rotation on the basis of the reverse order of precedence, to sit
                as a special member of said division with all the rights and prerogatives of a regular member of said
                division in the trial and determination of a case or cases assigned thereto. (<em>As amended by R.A.

                instituted with, and jointly determined in, the same proceeding by the Sandiganbayan or the appropriate
                courts, the filing of the criminal action being deemed to necessarily carry with it the filing of the
                civil action, and no right to reserve the filing of such civil action separately from the criminal
                action shall be recognized:&nbsp;<em>Provided, however,&nbsp;</em>That where the civil action had
                heretofore been filed separately but judgment therein has not yet been rendered, and the criminal case
                is hereafter filed with the Sandiganbayan or the appropriate court, said civil action shall be
                transferred to the Sandiganbayan or the appropriate court, as the case may be, &nbsp;for consolidation
                and joint determination with the criminal action, otherwise the separate civil action shall be deemed
                abandoned. (<em>As amended by R.A. No. 10660</em>)</p>


            <p><strong><em>Section 5. Proceedings, How Conducted; Decision by Majority Vote.</em></strong><em> &ndash; </em>All three (3) members of a division shall deliberate on all matters submitted for judgment, decision, final order, or resolution.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Section 6. Maximum period of termination of cases.</em></strong><em> &ndash;</em> As far as practicable, the trial of cases before the <em>Sandiganbayan </em>once commenced shall be continuous until terminated and the judgment shall be rendered within three (3) months from the date the case was submitted for decision.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Section 7. Form, Finality and Enforcement of Decisions</em></strong> &ndash; All decisions and final orders determining the merits of a case or finally disposing of the action or proceedings of the <em>Sandiganbayan</em> shall contain complete findings of the facts and the law on which they are based, on all issues properly raised before it and necessary in deciding the case.</p>
            <p>A petition for reconsideration of any final order or decision may be filed within fifteen (15) days from promulgation or notice of the final order or judgement, and such motion for reconsideration shall be decided within thirty (30) days from submission thereon.</p>
            <p>Decisions and final orders for the <em>Sandiganbayan</em> shall be appealable to the Supreme Court by petition for review on <em>certiorari</em> raising pure questions of law in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Whenever, in any case decided by the <em>Sandiganbayan</em>, the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua, </em>life imprisonment or death is imposed, the decision shall be appealable to the Supreme Court in the manner prescribed in the Rules of Court.</p>
            <p>Judgements and orders of the <em>Sandiganbayan</em> will be executed and enforced in the manner provided by law.</p>
            <p>Decisions and final order of other courts in cases cognizable by said courts under this decree as well as those rendered by them in exercise of their appellate jurisdiction shall be appealable to, or be reviewable by, the <em>Sandiganbayan </em>in the manner provided by Rule 122 of the Rules of Court.</p>
            <p>In case, however, the imposed penalty by the <em>Sandiganbayan</em> or the regional trial court in the proper exercise of their respective jurisdiction, is death, review by the Supreme Court shall be automatic, whether or not the accused files an appeal. <em>(As amended by R.A. No. 8249)</em></p>
            <p><strong><em>Section 8. Transfer of cases.</em></strong><em> &ndash; </em>As of the date of the effectivity of this decree any case cognizable by the <em>Sandiganbayan </em>within its exclusive jurisdiction where none of the accused has been arraigned shall be transferred to the <em>Sandiganbayan. </em></p>
            <p><strong><em>Section 9. Rules of Procedure.</em></strong><em> &ndash;</em> The Rules of Court promulgated by the Supreme Court shall apply to all cases and proceedings filed with the <em>Sandiganbayan</em>. The <em>Sandiganbayan</em> shall have no power to promulgate its own rules of procedure, except to adopt internal rules governing the allotment of cases among the division, the rotation of justices among them, and other matters relating to the internal operations of the court which shall be enforced until repealed or modified by the Supreme Court. <em>(As amended by R.A. No. 7975) </em></p>

            <p><s><strong><em>Section 10.
