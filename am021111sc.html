            <b>Sec. 10.  <i>Effect of failure to appear at the pre-trial.&#8211;</i></b>(1)  If the petitioner fails to appear personally, the case shall be dismissed unless his counsel or a duly authorized representative appears in court and proves a valid excuse for the non-appearance of the petitioner.



            (2)  If the respondent filed his answer but fails to appear, the court shall proceed with the pre-trial and require the public prosecutor to investigate the non-appearance of the respondent and submit within fifteen days a report to the court stating whether his non-appearance is due to any collusion between the parties. If there is no collusion, the court shall require the public prosecutor to intervene for the State during the trial on the merits to prevent suppression or fabrication of evidence.

            <p></p>

            <b>Sec. 11. <i>Pre-trial conference.</i></b>&#8211;At the pre-trial conference, the court may refer the issues to a mediator who shall assist the parties in reaching an agreement on matters not prohibited by law.

            The mediator shall render a report within one month from referral which, for good reasons, the court may extend for a period not exceeding one month.

            <p></p>
            In case mediation is not availed of or where it fails, the court shall proceed with the pre-trial conference, on which occasion it shall consider the advisability of receiving expert testimony and such other matters as may aid in the prompt disposition of the petition.
            <p></p>

            <b>Sec. 12. <i>Pre-trial order.</i></b>&#8211;(a) The proceedings in the pre-trial shall be recorded. Upon termination of the pre-trial, the court shall issue a pre-trial order which shall recite in detail the matters taken up in the conference, the action taken thereon, the amendments allowed on the pleadings, and, except as to the ground of legal separation, the agreements or admissions made by the parties on any of the matters considered, including any provisional order that may be necessary or agreed upon by the parties.
            <p></p>

            (b)  Should the action proceed to trial, the order shall contain a recital of the following:

            <ol>
                <li>   Facts undisputed, admitted, and those which need not be proved subject to Section 13 of this Rule;

                </li><li>   Factual and legal issues to be litigated;


            </li><li>   Evidence, including objects and documents, that have been marked and will be presented;

            </li><li>   Schedule of the presentation of evidence.
            </li></ol>

            <p></p>
            The pre-trial order shall also contain a directive to the public prosecutor to appear for the State and take steps to prevent collusion between the parties at any stage of the proceedings and fabrication or suppression of evidence during the trial on the merits.
            <p></p>

            (c)  The parties shall not be allowed to raise issues or present witnesses and evidence other than those stated in the pre-trial order. The order shall control the trial of the case unless modified by the court to prevent manifest injustice.

            <p></p>
            (d)  The parties shall have five days from receipt of the pre-trial order to propose corrections or modifications.
            <p></p>

            <b>Sec. 13.  <i>Prohibited compromise.</i></b>&#8211;The court shall not allow compromise on prohibited matters, such as the following:

            <ol>
                <li>   The civil status of persons;


                </li><li>   The validity of a marriage or of a legal separation;


            </li><li>   Any ground for legal separation;


            </li><li>   Future support;


            </li><li>   The jurisdiction of courts; and


            </li><li>   Future legitime. </li></ol>

            <p></p>
            <b>Sec. 14. <i>Trial.</i></b>&#8211;(a)  The presiding judge shall personally conduct the trial of the case. No delegation of the reception of evidence to a commissioner shall be allowed except as to matters involving property relations of the spouses.
            <p></p>

            (b)  The grounds for legal separation must be proved. No judgment on the pleadings, summary judgment, or confession of judgment shall be allowed.

            <p></p>
            (c)  The court may order the exclusion from the courtroom of all persons, including members of the press, who do not have a direct interest in the case. Such an order may be made if the court determines on the record that requiring a party to testify in open court would not enhance the ascertainment of truth; would cause to the party psychological harm or inability to effectively communicate due to embarrassment, fear, or timidity; would violate the party&#8217;s right to privacy; or would be offensive to decency or public morals.

            <p></p>
            (d)  No copy shall be taken nor any examination or perusal of the records of the case or parts thereof be made by any person other than a party or counsel of a party, except by order of the court.

            <p></p>
            <b>Sec. 15. <i>Memoranda.</i></b>&#8211;The court may require the parties and the public prosecutor to file their respective memoranda in support of their claims within fifteen days from the date the trial is terminated. No other pleadings or papers may be submitted without leave of court. After the lapse of the period herein provided, the case will be considered submitted for decision, with or without the memoranda.
            <p></p>

            <b>Sec. 16. <i>Decision.&#8211;</i></b>(a) The court shall deny the petition on any of the following grounds:

            <ol>
                <li>   The aggrieved party has condoned the offense or act complained of or has consented to the commission of the offense or act complained of;


                </li><li>   There is connivance in the commission of the offense or act constituting the ground for legal separation;


            </li><li>   Both parties have given ground for legal separation;


            </li><li>   There is collusion between the parties to obtain the decree of legal separation; or


            </li><li>   The action is barred by prescription.</li></ol>


            (b)  If the court renders a decision granting the petition, it shall declare therein that the Decree of Legal Separation shall be issued by the court only after full compliance with liquidation under the Family Code.


            However, in the absence of any property of the parties, the court shall forthwith issue a Decree of Legal Separation which shall be registered in the Civil Registry where the marriage was recorded and in the Civil Registry where the Family Court granting the legal separation is located.
