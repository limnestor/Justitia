The Commission shall enter an order declaring the registration statement to be effective if it finds that the registration statement together with all the other papers and documents attached thereto, is on its face complete and that the requirements have been complied with. The Commission may impose such terms and conditions as may be necessary or appropriate for the protection of the investors.<br><br>12.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon effectivity of the registration statement, the issuer shall state under oath in every prospectus that all registration requirements have been met and that all information are true and correct as represented by the issuer or the one making the statement.

The Commission may reject a registration statement and refuse registration of the security thereunder, or revoke the effectivity of a registration statement and the registration of the security thereunder after due notice and hearing by issuing an order to such effect, setting forth its findings in respect thereto, if it finds that:<br><ol type="a"><li>The issuer:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><ol type="i"><li> Has been judicially declared insolvent;<br></li><li> Has violated any of the provisions of this Code, the rules promulgated pursuant thereto, or any order of the Commission of which the issuer has notice in connection with the offering for which a registration statement has been filed;<br></li><li>Has been or is engaged or is about to engage in fraudulent transactions;<br></li><li> Has made any false or misleading representation of material facts in any prospectus concerning the issuer or its securities;<br></li><li> Has failed to comply with any requirement that the Commission may impose as a condition for registration of the security for which the registration statement has been filed; or<br></li></ol></div></li><li>The registration statement is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or<br></li><li>The issuer, any officer, director or controlling person of the issuer, or person performing similar functions, or any underwriter has been convicted, by a competent judicial or administrative body, upon plea of guilty, or otherwise, of an offense involving moral turpitude and/or fraud or is enjoined or restrained by the Commission or other competent judicial or administrative body for violations of securities, commodities, and other related laws.<br></li></ol>For purposes of this subsection, the term "competent judicial or administrative body" shall include a foreign court of competent jurisdiction as provided for under the Rules of Court.<br><br>13.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission may compel the production of all the books and papers of such issuer, and may administer oaths to, and examine the officers of such issuer or any other person connected therewith as to its business and affairs.<br><br>13.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any issuer shall refuse to permit an examination to be made by the Commission, its refusal shall be ground for the refusal or revocation of the registration of its securities.<br><br>13.4.&nbsp; If the Commission deems it necessary, it may issue an order suspending the offer and sale of the securities pending any investigation. The order shall state the grounds for taking such action, but such order of suspension although binding upon the persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be published. Upon the issuance of the suspension order, no further offer or sale of such security shall be made until the same is lifted or set aside by the Commission. Otherwise, such sale shall be void.<br><br>13.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of issuance of such order shall be given to the issuer and every dealer and broker who shall have notified the Commission of an intention to sell such security.<br><br>13.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; A registration statement may be withdrawn by the issuer only with the consent of the Commission.<br><br>SEC. 14. <span style="font-style: italic;">Amendments to the Registration Statement.</span> &#8212; 14.1. If a registration statement is on its face incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, the Commission shall issue an order directing the amendment of the registration statement. Upon compliance with such order, the amended registration statement shall become effective in accordance with the procedure mentioned in Subsection 12.6 hereof.<br><br>14.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; An amendment filed prior to the effective date of the registration statement shall recommence the forty-five (45) day period within which the Commission shall act on a registration statement. An amendment filed after the effective date of the registration statement shall become effective only upon such date as determined by the Commission.<br><br>14.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any change occurs in the facts set forth in a registration statement, the issuer shall file an amendment thereto setting forth the change.<br><br>14.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, at any time, the Commission finds that a registration statement contains any false statement or omits to state any fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Commission may conduct an examination, and, after due notice and hearing, issue an Order suspending the effectivity of the registration statement. If the statement is duly amended, the suspension order may be lifted.<br><br>14.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; In making such examination the Commission or any officer or officers designated by it may administer oaths and affirmations and shall have access to, and may demand the production of, any books, records or documents relevant to the examination. Failure of the issuer, underwriter, or any other person to cooperate, or his obstruction or refusal to undergo an examination, shall be a ground for the issuance of a suspension order.<br><br>SEC. 15. <span style="font-style: italic;">Suspension of Registration</span>. &#8212; 15.1. If, at any time, the information contained in the registration statement filed is or has become misleading, incorrect, inadequate or incomplete in any material respect, or the sale or offering for sale of the security registered thereunder may work or tend to work a fraud, the Commission may require from the issuer such further information as may in its judgment be necessary to enable the Commission to ascertain whether the registration of such security should be revoked on any ground specified in this Code. The Commission may also suspend the right to sell and offer for sale such security pending further investigation, by entering an order specifying the grounds for such action, and by notifying the issuer, underwriter, dealer or broker known as participating in such offering.<br><br>15.2.&nbsp; The refusal to furnish information required by the Commission may be a ground for the issuance of an order of suspension pursuant to Subsection 15.1. Upon the issuance of any such order and notification to the issuer, underwriter, dealer or broker known as participating in such offering, no further offer or sale of any such security shall be made until the same is lifted or set aside by the Commission. Otherwise, such sale shall be void.<br><br>15.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon issuance of an order of suspension, the Commission shall conduct a hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Commission determines that the sale of any security should be revoked, it shall issue an order prohibiting sale of such security.<br><br>Until the issuance of a final order, the suspension of the right to sell, though binding upon the persons notified thereof, shall be deemed confidential, and shall not be published, unless it shall appear that the order of suspension has been violated after notice. If, however, the Commission finds that the sale of the security will neither be fraudulent nor result in fraud, it shall forthwith issue an order revoking the order of suspension, and such security shall be restored to its status as a registered security as of the date of such order of suspension.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CHAPTER IV</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">REGULATION OF PRE-NEED PLANS</span><br></div><br>SEC. 16. <span style="font-style: italic;">Pre-Need Plans.</span> &#8212; No person shall sell or offer for sale to the public any pre-need plan except in accordance with rules and regulations which the Commission shall prescribe.
