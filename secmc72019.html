                <b>TO : All Concerned</b><br>
                <b>SUBJECT: <u>Guidelines on the Establishment of a One Person Corporation (OPC)</u></b>
            </p>

            <p>In accordance with the power and function of the Securities and Exchange Commission to formulate and enforce standards and policies to carry out the provisions of Republic Act 11232, the Act providing for the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines (RCC), the following guidelines, rules and regulations in the establishment of a One Person Corporation (OPC) are hereby adopted:</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 1. Definition and Incorporator.</b></p>

            <p>A one person corporation (OPC) is a corporation with a single stockholder, who can only be a natural person, trust or estate. The incorporator of an OPC being a natural person must be of legal age. As an incorporator, the "trust" as used by the law does not refer to a trust entity, but the subject being managed by a trustee. If the single stockholder is a trustee, administrator, executor, guardian, conservator, custodian, or other person exercising fiduciary duties, proof of authority to act on behalf of the trust or estate must be submitted at the time of incorporation.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 2. Term of Existence.</b></p>

            <p>The term of existence of the OPC shall be perpetual. However, in case of the trust or estate, its term of existence shall be co-terminous with the existence of the trust or estate. The OPC under the name of the estate may be dissolved upon proof of Partition, such as Order of Partition issued by the Court in case of Judicial Settlement and Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement in case of summary settlement of the estate. The OPC under the name of the Trustee may be dissolved upon proof of termination of the trust.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 3. Corporate Name.</b></p>

            <p>The suffix "OPC" should be indicated by the one person corporation either below or at the end of its corporate name.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 4. Single Stockholder as Director and Officer.</b></p>

            <p>The single stockholder shall be the sole director and president of the OPC.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 5. Designation of Nominee and Alternate Nominee.</b></p>

            <p>The single stockholder is required to designate a nominee and an alternate nominee named in the Articles of Incorporation who shall replace the single stockholder in the event of the latter's death and/or incapacity. The written consent of both the nominee and alternate nominee shall be attached to the application for incorporation.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 6. Only Articles of Incorporation Needed.</b></p>

            <p>The OPC shall file its Articles of Incorporation (Al) in accordance with the requirements of Section 14 of the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines. The Al must set forth its primary purpose, principal office address, term of existence, names and details of the single stockholder, the nominee and alternate nominee and the authorized, subscribed and paid-up capital and such other matters consistent with law and which may be deemed necessary and convenient. For facility of registration, applicants may follow the attached sample of the Articles of Incorporation of an OPC.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 7. Bylaws.</b></p>

            <p>The OPC is not required to submit and file its Bylaws.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 8. Minimum Capital Stock Not Required.</b></p>

            <p>The OPC is not required to have a minimum authorized capital stock except as otherwise provided by special law. Further, unless otherwise required by applicable laws or regulations, no portion of the authorized capital is required to be paid-up at the time of incorporation.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 9. Officers.</b></p>

            <p>Within fifteen (15) days from the issuance of its Certificate of Incorporation, the OPC shall appoint a Treasurer, Corporate Secretary, and other officers, and notify the SEC thereof within five (5) days from appointment, using the Appointment Form as may be prescribed by the SEC. The single stockholder shall not be appointed as Corporate Secretary but may assume the role of a Treasurer.</p>

            <p><b>SECTION 10. Bond Requirement for the Self-Appointed Treasurer.</b></p>

            <p>The single stockholder who assumes the position of the Treasurer shall post a surety bond to be computed based on the authorized capital stock (ACS) of the OPC as shown in the Table below:</p>
