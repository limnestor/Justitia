concerted activities for purposes of collective bargaining or for their mutual
benefit and protection. The right of legitimate labor organizations to strike
and picket and of employers to lockout, consistent with the national interest,
shall continue to be recognized and respected. However, no labor union may
strike and no employer may declare a lockout on grounds involving inter-union
and intra-union disputes.</span></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Bookman Old Style",serif'>(c) In cases of bargaining deadlocks, the duly
certified or recognized bargaining agent may file a notice of strike or the
employer may file a notice of lockout with the Ministry at least 30 days before
the intended date thereof. In cases of unfair labor practice, the period of
notice shall be 15 days and in the absence of a duly certified or recognized
bargaining agent, the notice of strike may be filed by any legitimate labor
organization in behalf of its members. However, in case of dismissal from
employment of union officers duly elected in accordance with the union
constitution and by-laws, which may constitute union busting where the existence
of the union is threatened, the 15-day cooling-off period shall not apply and
the union may take action immediately.</span></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

duty of the Ministry to exert all efforts at mediation and conciliation to
effect a voluntary settlement. Should the dispute remain unsettled until the
lapse of the requisite number of days from the mandatory filing of the notice,
the labor union may strike or the employer may declare a lockout.</span></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
"Bookman Old Style",serif'>(f) A decision to declare a strike must be approved
by a majority of the total union membership in the bargaining unit concerned,
obtained by secret ballot in meetings or referenda called for that purpose. A
decision to declare a lockout must be approved by a majority of the board of
directors of the corporation or association or of the partners in a
partnership, obtained by secret ballot in a meeting called for that purpose.
The decision shall be valid for the duration of the dispute based on
substantially the same grounds considered when the strike or lockout vote was
taken. The Ministry may, at its own initiative or upon the request of any
affected party, supervise the conduct of the secret balloting. In every case,
the union or the employer shall furnish the Ministry the results of the voting
at least seven days before the intended strike or lockout, subject to the
cooling-off period herein provided.</span></p>

dispute causing or likely to cause a strike or lockout in an industry
indispensable to the national interest, the Secretary of Labor and Employment
may assume jurisdiction over the dispute and decide it or certify the same to
the Commission for compulsory arbitration. Such assumption or certification
shall have the effect of automatically enjoining the intended or impending
strike or lockout as specified in the assumption or certification order. If one
has already taken place at the time of assumption or certification, all
striking or locked out employees shall immediately return to work and the
employer shall immediately resume operations and readmit all workers under the
same terms and conditions prevailing before the strike or lockout. The
Secretary of Labor and Employment or the Commission may seek the assistance of
law enforcement agencies to ensure compliance with this provision as well as
with such orders as he may issue to enforce the same.</span></p>

and lockouts in hospitals, clinics and similar medical institutions shall, to
every extent possible, be avoided, and all serious efforts, not only by labor
and management but government as well, be exhausted to substantially minimize,
if not prevent, their adverse effects on such life and health, through the
exercise, however legitimate, by labor of its right to strike and by management
to lockout. In labor disputes adversely affecting the continued operation of
such hospitals, clinics or medical institutions, it shall be the duty of the
striking union or locking-out employer to provide and maintain an effective
skeletal workforce of medical and other health personnel, whose movement and
services shall be unhampered and unrestricted, as are necessary to insure the
proper and adequate protection of the life and health of its patients, most
especially emergency cases, for the duration of the strike or lockout. In such
cases, therefore, the Secretary of Labor and Employment may immediately assume,
within twenty four (24) hours from knowledge of the occurrence of such a strike
or lockout, jurisdiction over the same or certify it to the Commission for
compulsory arbitration. For this purpose, the contending parties are strictly
enjoined to comply with such orders, prohibitions and/or injunctions as are
issued by the Secretary of Labor and Employment or the Commission, under pain
of immediate disciplinary action, including dismissal or loss of employment
status or payment by the locking-out employer of backwages, damages and other
affirmative relief, even criminal prosecution against either or both of them.</span></p>
