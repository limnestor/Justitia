Only when such efforts prove insufficient and no appropriate placement or adoption by an unrelated person be considered.</p>
            <p align="justify">The best interest of the child shall be the paramount consideration in the enactment of alternative care, custody, and adoption policies. It shall be in accordance with the tenets set forth in all the rights of the child enumerated under Article 3 of Presidential Decree No. 603, otherwise known as the “Child and Youth Welfare Code”; the “United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)”; the “United Nations Guidelines on Alternative Care of Children”; the “United Nations Declaration on Social and Legal Principles Relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children with Special Internationally’; and the “Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption”.</p>

                <p align="justify">(b) Establish alternative care standards to ensure that the quality of life and living conditions set are conducive to the child’s development;</p>
                <p align="justify">(c) Safeguard the biological parents from making hasty decisions to relinquish parental authority over the child;</p>
                <p>(d) Prevent unnecessary separation of the child from the biological parents;</p>
                <p align="justify">(e) Protect the adoptive parents from attempts to disturb their parental authority and custody over the adopted child;</p>

            <p align="justify">At the time of preparation of the prospective adoptive child’s case study, the concerned adoption social worker shall confirm with the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) the real identity and registered name of the prospective adoptee. If the birth of a prospective adoptee was not registered with the PSA, it shall be the responsibility of the said social worker to ensure that said prospective adoptee is registered.</p>
            <p align="justify">The case study on the prospective adoptive child shall establish that said child is legally available for adoption and that the documents to support this fact are valid and authentic.</p>
            <p align="justify">Further, the case study of the prospective adopters shall ascertain their genuine intentions and that the adoption is in the best interest of the child. If the adoption social worker determines that the adoption shall redound to the best interests of the child, a recommendation shall be made to the RACCO or the NACC for the petition to be granted; otherwise, a denial thereof shall be recommended. Upon discovery of new information that would warrant denial of the petition to protect the best interest of the child, the said social worker is duty bound to report the same to the RACCO or the NACC.</p>
