            <h3 style="text-align: center;">RULE 2</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Nature of Proceedings</strong></em></h4>
            <p>SECTION 1. <em>Scope</em>. &mdash; Rules 2 to 9 shall apply to all civil actions for violations of intellectual property rights provided for in Republic Act No. 8293 or the Intellectual Property Code, as amended, including Repetition of Infringement of Patent (Section 84), Utility Model (Section 108) and Industrial Design and Layout of Integrated Circuits (Section 119), Trademark Infringement (Section 155 in relation to Section 170), Unfair Competition (Section 168 in relation to Section 170), False Designations of Origin; False Description or Representation (Section 169.1 in relation to Section 170), infringement of copyright, moral rights, performers' rights, producers' rights, and broadcasting rights (Sections 177, 193, 203, 208 and 211 in relation to Section 216), Infringement of Plant Variety Protection under Republic Act No. 9168 or the Plant Variety Protection Act (Section 47), and other violations of intellectual property rights as may be defined by law.</p>

The issuance of these writs shall be governed by the rules prescribed in <em>Re: Rule on Search and Seizure in Civil Actions for Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights</em> (A.M. No. 02-1-06-SC). Within their respective territorial jurisdictions, the Special Commercial Courts in the judicial regions where the violation of intellectual property rights occurred shall have concurrent jurisdiction to issue writs of search and seizure.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">RULE 3</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Commencement of Action</em></h4>
            <p>SECTION 1. <em>Pleadings</em>. &mdash; The only pleadings allowed to be filed are the complaints, compulsory counterclaims and cross-claims pleaded in the answer, and the answers thereto, as well as those not expressly prohibited under Section 4 of this Rule. All pleadings shall be verified.</p>
            <p>SECTION 2. <em>Who May File an Action under These Rules</em>. &mdash; Any intellectual property right owner, or anyone possessing any exclusive right, title or interest under claim of ownership in any intellectual property right, or an exclusive licensee to a copyright, whose right may have been violated, may file an action under these Rules.</p>
            <p>Any person who is a national, or who is domiciled, or has a real and effective industrial establishment in a country which is a party to any convention, treaty or agreement relating to intellectual property rights or the repression of unfair competition, to which the Philippines is also a party, or extends reciprocal rights to nationals of the Philippines by law, shall be entitled to file an action under these Rules.</p>
            <p>Any foreign national or juridical person who meets the requirements of the immediately preceding paragraph, and does not engage in business in the Philippines, may also file an action under these Rules.</p>
            <p>SECTION 3. <em>Form and Contents of the Complaint</em>. &mdash; The complaint shall be verified and shall state the full names of the parties to the case. Facts showing the capacity of a party to sue or be sued, or the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity, or the legal existence of an organized association of persons that is made a party, must be averred. In case of juridical entities, proof of capacity to sue must be attached to the complaint.</p>
            <p>The complaint shall contain a concise statement of the ultimate facts, including the evidence, constituting the complainant's cause(s) of action. It shall specify the relief(s) sought, but it may add a general prayer for such further or other relief(s) as may be deemed just or equitable.</p>
            <p>The judicial affidavits referred to in Section 5 hereof and the relevant evidence shall be made part of the complaint.</p>
            <p>The complaint shall include a certification that the party commencing the action has not filed any other action or proceeding involving the same issue(s) before any tribunal, agency, or quasi-judicial body nor is such action or proceeding pending before any other tribunal, agency or quasi-judicial body; <em>Provided, however</em>, that if any such action is pending, the status of the same must be stated, and should knowledge thereof be acquired after the filing of the complaint, the party concerned shall undertake to notify the court within five (5) calendar days from such knowledge.</p>
            <p>When the party-litigant is a juridical entity, the verification/certification of nonforum shopping required should be executed by a natural person duly authorized by the juridical entity, through a special power of attorney or a resolution issued by the juridical entity for the purpose, attached to the complaint.</p>
            <p>The complaint shall further be accompanied by proof of payment of docket and other lawful fees.</p>
            <p>Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be remedied by mere amendment of the complaint. The court, <em>motu proprio</em>, shall dismiss the case without prejudice.</p>
            <p>The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative, civil and criminal liabilities. If the acts of a party or their counsel clearly constitute willful and&middot; deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be a ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt.</p>
            <p>SECTION 4. <em>Prohibited Pleadings and Motions</em>. &mdash; The following pleadings and motions are prohibited:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Motion to dismiss, except on the following grounds:
                    <ol>
                        <li>That the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter;</li>
                        <li>That there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause; or</li>
                        <li>That the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment or by statute of limitation.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Motion for reconsideration of a final order or judgment, except with regard to an order of destruction issued under Rule 20 hereof;</li>
                <li>Reply, except when an actionable document is attached in the Answer;</li>
                <li>Petition for relief from judgment;</li>
                <li>Motion for extension of time to file pleadings or other written submissions, except for the answer for meritorious reasons and provided that only one (1) motion for extension of time to file an answer shall be allowed, which shall not exceed thirty (30) calendar days;</li>
                <li>Motion for postponement, except if it is based on acts of God, <em>force majeure</em>, or physical inability of the witness to appear and testify. The grounds raised for the postponement of the hearing due to physical inability of the witness to appear must be justified and substantiated. A motion for postponement, whether written or oral, shall, at all times, be accompanied by the original official receipt from the Office of the Clerk of Court evidencing payment of the postponement fee under Section 21 (b), Rule 141 of the Rules of Court, to be submitted either at the time of the filing of said motion or not later than the next hearing date;</li>
                <li>Third-party complaint;</li>
                <li>Motion to hear affirmative defenses; and</li>
                <li>Any pleading or motion which is similar to or of like effect as any of the foregoing.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>SECTION 5. <em>Judicial Affidavits</em>. &mdash; The judicial affidavits required to be submitted with the complaint in a question-and-answer format numbered consecutively shall state only facts of direct personal knowledge of the affiants which are admissible in evidence. The judicial affidavits shall also show the competence of the affiants to testify to the matters stated therein.</p>
            <p>A violation of this requirement may subject the party or the counsel who submits the same to disciplinary action, and shall be a ground for the court to order that the inadmissible affidavit or portion thereof be expunged from the records.</p>
            <p>SECTION 6. <em>Failure to File Complaint Where a Writ of Search and Seizure is&nbsp;</em><em>Issued</em>. &mdash; Upon motion of the party whose goods have been seized, with notice to the applicant, the issuing court may lift its writ and order the return of the seized goods if no case is filed with the appropriate court and/or quasi-judicial agency, including the IPO, within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of issuance of the writ.</p>
            <p>If upon hearing of the motion, even when no complaint was filed but the seized goods are hazardous under Rule 20, upon due notice to appropriate government regulatory agencies, the court shall order the destruction of the same.</p>
            <p>If no motion for the return of the seized goods is filed within sixty (60) calendar days from the issuance of the writ under the first paragraph, the court shall order the disposal and/or destruction of the goods, as may be warranted under Rule 20, after hearing with notice to the parties.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">RULE 4</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Summons, Orders, Court Processes, and Answer</h4>
            <p>SECTION 1. <em>Summons</em>. &mdash; The summons and the complaint, including its attachments, shall be served not later than five (5) calendar days from receipt of the complaint by the court to which it is assigned or raffled.</p>
            <p>SECTION 2. <em>Service of Summons, Orders and Other Court Processes.</em> &mdash;</p>
            <p>Summons, orders and other court processes may be served by the sheriff, their deputy or other proper court officer or for justifiable reasons, by the counsel or representative of the plaintiff or any suitable person authorized by the court issuing the summons.</p>
            <p>Any private person who is authorized by the court to serve summons, orders and other court processes shall, for that purpose, be considered an officer of the court.</p>
            <p>If, for justifiable causes, the defendant cannot be served personally after at least three (3) attempts on two (2) different dates, service may be effected:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>By leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's residence to a person at least eighteen (18) years of age and of sufficient discretion residing therein;</li>
                <li>By leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's office or regular place of business with some competent person in charge thereof. A competent person includes, but is not limited to, one who customarily receives correspondences for the defendant;</li>
                <li>By leaving copies of the summons, if refused entry upon making his or her authority and purpose known, with any of the officers of the homeowners' association or condominium corporation, or its chief security officer in charge of the community or the building where the defendant may be found; and</li>
                <li>By sending an electronic mail to the defendant's electronic mail address, if allowed by the court.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When the defendant is a foreign private juridical entity which has transacted or is doing business in the Philippines, as defined by law, service may be made on its resident agent designated in accordance with law for that purpose, or, if there be no such agent, on the government official designated by law to that effect, or on any of its officers, agents, directors or trustees within the Philippines.</p>
            <p>If the foreign private juridical entity is not registered in the Philippines, or has no resident agent but has transacted or is doing business in it, as defined by law, such service may, with leave of court, be effected outside of the Philippines through any of the following means:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>By personal service coursed through the appropriate court in the foreign country with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs;</li>
                <li>By publication once in a newspaper of general circulation in the country where the defendant may be found and by serving a copy of the summons and the court order by registered mail at the last known address of the defendant;</li>
                <li>By facsimile;</li>
                <li>By electronic means with the prescribed proof of service; or</li>
                <li>By such other means as the court, in its discretion, may direct.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Should either personal or substituted service fail, summons by publication shall be allowed. In the case of juridical entities, summons by publication shall be done by indicating the names of the officers or their duly authorized representative. Extraterritorial service of summons, as provided for in international conventions to which the Philippines is a party, shall also be allowed.</p>
            <p>SECTION 3. <em>Answer</em>. &mdash; Within thirty (30) calendar days from service of summons, the defendant shall file his or her answer to the complaint, including the evidence therein, and serve a copy thereof on the plaintiff. Affirmative and negative defenses not pleaded in the answer shall be deemed waived, except when the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, when there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause, or when the action is barred by a prior judgment or by the statute of limitations. Cross-claims and compulsory counterclaims not asserted in the answer shall be considered barred. The answer to counterclaims or cross-claims shall be filed and served within fifteen (15) calendar days from service of the answer in which they are pleaded.</p>
            <p>SECTION 4. <em>Effect of Failure to Answer</em>. &mdash; Should the defendant fail to answer the complaint within the period stated above, the court, <em>motu proprio</em> or on motion of the plaintiff, shall render judgment as may be warranted by the allegations of the complaint, as well as the affidavits and other evidence on record, unless the court in its discretion requires the plaintiff to submit additional evidence. Such reception of additional evidence may be delegated to the clerk of court. In no case shall the court award a relief beyond or different from that prayed for; <em>Provided</em>, that the court may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of damages and attorney's fees claimed for being excessive or otherwise unconscionable.</p>
            <p>SECTION 5. <em>Judicial Affidavits</em>. &mdash; The judicial affidavits required to be submitted with the answer in a question-and-answer format numbered consecutively shall state only facts of direct personal knowledge of the affiants which are admissible in evidence. The judicial affidavits shall also show the competence of the affiants to testify to the matters stated therein.</p>
            <p>A violation of this requirement may subject the party or the counsel who submits the same to disciplinary action, and shall be ground for the court to order that the inadmissible affidavit or portion thereof be expunged from the records.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">RULE 5</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Modes of Discovery</h4>
            <p>SECTION 1. <em>In General</em>. &mdash; A party can avail of any of the modes of discovery in accordance with the Rules of Court not later than thirty (30) calendar days from the joinder of issues.</p>
            <p>SECTION 2. <em>Objections</em>. &mdash; Any mode of discovery, such as interrogatories, request for admission, production or inspection of documents or things, may be objected to within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the request for discovery and only on the ground that the matter requested is manifestly incompetent, immaterial, or irrelevant or is undisclosed information or privileged in nature, or the request is for harassment. The requesting party may comment in writing within three (3) calendar days from receipt of the objection. Thereafter, the court shall rule on the objection not later than ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the comment or the expiration of the three-day period.</p>
            <p>SECTION 3. <em>Depositions</em>. &mdash; Upon <em>ex parte</em> motion of a party, the deponent may be examined regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject of the pending action, subject to the provisions of Rule 23 of the Rules of Court.</p>
            <p>The court may allow a deponent to give his or her deposition through electronic means, such as teleconferencing or videoconferencing.</p>
            <p>The other modes of discovery under the Rules of Court, including the use of electronic means, shall be allowed.</p>

If the motion for leave is denied, the court shall issue an order for the accused to present and terminate his or her evidence on the dates previously scheduled and agreed upon, and to orally offer and rest his or her case on the day his or her last witness is presented.</p>
            <p>If despite the denial of the motion for leave, the accused insists on filing a demurrer to evidence, or if the accused files a demurrer to evidence without seeking a prior leave of court, the previously scheduled dates for the accused to present evidence shall be cancelled, and the accused shall be deemed to have waived the right to present evidence and submits the case for judgment on the basis of the evidence of the prosecution.</p>

The court shall rule on the oral offer of evidence of the accused and the comment or objection of the prosecution on the same day of the offer. If the court denies the motion to present rebuttal evidence because it is no longer necessary, it shall consider the case submitted for decision.</p>
            <p>If the court grants the motion to present rebuttal evidence, the prosecution shall immediately proceed with its presentation after the accused had rested his/her case, and orally rest its case in rebuttal after the presentation of its last rebuttal witness. Thereafter, the accused shall immediately present sur-rebuttal evidence, if there is any, and orally rest the case in sur-rebuttal after the presentation of its last sur-rebuttal witness. Thereafter, the court shall submit the case for decision.</p>

            <p>For documents originating from a foreign country which is not party to a treaty or convention referred to in the next preceding sentence, the certificate regarding such document may be made by a secretary of the embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice-consul, or consular agent, or by any officer in the foreign service of the Philippines stationed in the foreign country in which the record is kept, and authenticated by the seal of his or her office.</p>
            <p>A document that is accompanied by a certificate or its equivalent may be presented in evidence without further proof, the certificate or its equivalent being <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the due execution and genuineness of the document involved. The certificate shall not be required when a treaty or convention between a foreign country and the Philippines has abolished the requirement, or has exempted the document itself from this formality.</p>
            <p>SECTION 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Deposition of Foreign Witness</em>. &mdash; The deposition of any witness abroad shall be taken within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of the order allowing the deposition, unless the failure to take the deposition within the period is caused by a fortuitous event, fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence.

            <p>SECTION 1. <em>Burden of Proof in Patent Infringement; Presumption regarding&nbsp;</em><em>Process Patents</em>. &mdash; a) The burden of proof to substantiate a charge for patent infringement rests on the party alleging the same, subject, however, to sub-Section b) below, and other applicable laws.</p>
            <p>b) If the subject matter of a patent is a process for obtaining a product, any identical product is presumed to have been obtained through the use of the patented process if: (i) the product is new; or (ii) there is substantial likelihood that the identical product was made by the process and the owner of the patent has been unable, despite reasonable efforts, to determine the process actually used. In such cases, the court shall then order the defendant or alleged infringer to prove that the process to obtain the identical product is different from the patented process, subject to the court's adoption of measures to protect, as far as practicable, said defendant or alleged infringer's manufacturing and business secrets.</p>
            <p>SECTION 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Patents Issued Presumed Valid</em>. &mdash; In all cases, a letters patent issued by the IPO-Bureau of Patents, or successor-agencies, is <em>prima facie</em> evidence of its existence and validity during the term specified therein against all persons, unless the same has already been cancelled or voided by a final and executory judgment or order.</p>
            <p>Moreover, letters patents issued by the IPO-Bureau of Patents, or successoragencies, are presumed to have been validly issued by said government agency in accordance with applicable laws, unless otherwise contradicted or overcome by other admissible evidence showing that the same was irregularly issued.</p>
            <p>SECTION 3. <em>Presumption regarding Knowledge of Existing Patent Rights</em>. &mdash;</p>
            <p>For purposes of awarding damages in patent infringement cases, it is presumed that the defendant or alleged infringer knew of the existence of a patent over a protected invention or process, if: (a) on the patented invention or product manufactured using the patented process; (b) on the container or package in which said article is supplied to the public; or (c) on the advertising material relating to the patented product or process, are placed the words "Philippine Patent" with the number of the patent.</p>
            <p>SECTION 4. <em>Request for Technical Advice</em>. &mdash; In patent infringement cases, the court, <em>motu proprio</em> or upon motion by a party, may appoint one (1) expert, or order the creation of a committee of three (3) experts to provide advice on the technical aspects of the patent in dispute, including construction of claims, if necessary.</p>
            <p>If the court orders the creation of a committee of three (3) experts, each party shall, within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of such order, nominate an expert, who shall then both be appointed by the court. Thereafter, the court shall appoint the third expert from a list submitted by the experts of each side.</p>
            <p>All fees and expenses relating to the appointment of an expert or committee of experts shall be initially equally shouldered by the parties but may later on be adjudicated by the court in favor of the prevailing party.</p>
            <p>To assist in the trial involving highly-technical evidence or matters, the court may also request the IPO to provide equipment, technical facilities, and personnel.</p>
            <p>SECTION 5. <em>Application to Utility Models and Industrial Designs</em>. &mdash; The above rules shall likewise be applicable to infringement cases involving utility models and industrial designs, with corresponding registrability report.</p>

            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Evidence in Trademark Infringement and Unfair Competition Cases</h4>
            <p>SECTION 1. <em>Certificate of Registration</em>. &mdash; A certificate of registration of a mark shall be <em>prima facie</em> evidence of:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>the validity of the registration;</li>
                <li>the registrant's ownership of the mark; and</li>
                <li>the registrant's exclusive right to use the same in connection with the goods or services and those that are related thereto specified in the certificate.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>SECTION 2. <em>Evidence of Actual Use</em>. &mdash; The following shall be accepted as proof of actual use of the mark:</p>

                <li>Brochures or advertising materials showing the actual use of the mark on the goods being sold or services being rendered in the Philippines;</li>
                <li>For online sale, receipts of sale of the goods or services rendered or other similar evidence of use, showing that the goods are placed on the market or the services are available in the Philippines or that the transaction took place in the Philippines;</li>
                <li>Copies of contracts for services showing the use of the mark. Computer printouts of the drawing or reproduction of marks will not be accepted as evidence of use; and</li>
                <li>Such other proofs that the court may deem acceptable.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>SECTION 3. <em>Well-Known Mark</em>. &mdash; In determining whether a mark is wellknown, account shall be taken of the knowledge of the relevant sector of the public, rather than of the public at large, including knowledge in the Philippines which has been obtained as a result of the promotion of the mark. The following criteria or any combination thereof may be taken into account in determining whether a mark is wellknown:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>the duration, extent and geographical area of any use of the mark; in particular, the duration, extent and geographical area of any promotion of the mark, including advertising or publicity and the presentation, at fairs or exhibitions, of the goods and/or services to which the mark applies;</li>
                <li>the market share, in the Philippines and in other countries, of the goods and/or services to which the mark applies;</li>
                <li>the degree of the inherent or acquired distinction of the mark;</li>
                <li>the quality-image or reputation acquired by the mark;</li>
                <li>the extent to which the mark has been registered in the world;</li>
                <li>the exclusivity of registration attained by the mark in the world;</li>
                <li>the extent to which the mark has been used in the world;</li>
                <li>the exclusivity of use attained by the mark in the world;</li>
                <li>the commercial value attributed to the mark in the world;</li>
                <li>the record of successful protection of the rights in the mark;</li>
                <li>the outcome of litigations dealing with the issue of whether the mark is a well-known mark; and</li>
                <li>the presence or absence of identical or similar marks validly registered for or used on identical or similar goods or services and owned by persons other than the person claiming that his or her mark is a well-known mark.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><em>Provided</em>, that the mark may be well-known, regardless of whether the mark is registered in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>SECTION 4. <em>Presumption of Likelihood of Confusion</em>. &mdash; Likelihood of confusion shall be presumed in case an identical sign or mark is used for identical goods or services.</p>
            <p>SECTION 5. <em>Likelihood of Confusion in Other Cases</em>. &mdash; In determining whether one trademark is confusingly similar to or is a colorable imitation of another, the court must consider the general impression of the ordinary purchaser, buying under the normally prevalent conditions in trade, and giving the attention such purchasers usually give in buying that class of goods. Visual, aural, connotative comparisons and overall impressions engendered by the marks in controversy as they are encountered in the realities of the marketplace must be taken into account. Where there are both similarities and differences in the marks, these must be weighed against one another to determine which predominates.</p>
            <p>In determining likelihood of confusion between marks used on non-identical goods or services, several factors may be taken into account, such as, but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>the strength of plaintiff's mark;</li>
                <li>the degree of similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's marks;</li>
                <li>the proximity of the products or services;</li>
                <li>the likelihood that the plaintiff will bridge the gap;</li>
                <li>evidence of actual confusion;</li>
                <li>the defendant's good faith in adopting the mark;</li>
                <li>the quality of defendant's product or service; and/or</li>
                <li>the sophistication of the buyers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>"Colorable imitation" denotes such a close or ingenious imitation as to be calculated to deceive ordinary persons, or such a resemblance to the original as to deceive an ordinary purchaser giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives, as to cause him or her to purchase the one supposing it to be the other.</p>
            <p>Absolute certainty of confusion or even actual confusion is not required to accord protection to trademarks already registered with the IPO.</p>
            <p>SECTION 6. <em>Likelihood of Confusion; Determination of Related Goods or&nbsp;Services</em>. &mdash; Goods or services may not be considered as being similar or dissimilar to each other on the ground that, in any registration or publication by the Office, they appear in same or different classes of the Nice Classification.</p>
            <p>SECTION 7.&nbsp; <em>Intent to Defraud or Deceive</em>. &mdash; In an action for unfair&nbsp;competition, intent to defraud or deceive the public shall be presumed:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>when the defendant passes off a product as theirs by using imitative devices, signs or marks on the general appearance of the goods, which misleads prospective purchasers into buying their merchandise under the impression that they are buying that of their competitors;</li>
                <li>when the defendant makes any false statement in the course of trade to discredit the goods and business of another; or</li>
                <li>where the similarity in the appearance of the goods as packed and offered for sale is so striking.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>SECTION 8. <em>Generic Marks</em>. &mdash; A registered mark shall not be deemed to be the generic name of goods or services solely because such mark is also used as a name of or to identify a unique product or service.</p>
            <p>The test for determining whether the mark is or has become the generic name of goods or services on or in connection with which it has been used shall be the primary significance of the mark to the relevant public rather than purchaser motivation.</p>
            <p>SECTION 9.&nbsp; <em>Market Survey</em>. &mdash; A market survey is a scientific market or consumer survey which a party may offer in evidence to prove (a) the primary</p>
            <p>significance of a mark to the relevant public, including its distinctiveness, its descriptive or generic status, its strength or well-known status and/or (b) likelihood of confusion.</p>

            <h4 style="text-align: center;">Evidence in Copyright Cases</h4>
            <p>SECTION 1. <em>When Copyright Presumed to Subsist</em>. &mdash; In copyright&nbsp;infringement cases, copyright shall be presumed to subsist in the work or other subject matter to which the action relates, and ownership thereof shall be presumed to belong to complainant if he, she, or it so claims through affidavit evidence under Section 218 of the Intellectual Property Code, as amended.</p>
            <p>Copyright shall be presumed to subsist in the work or other subject matter to which the action relates if the defendant or accused does not put in issue the question of whether copyright subsists in the work or other subject matter.</p>
            <p>Where the subsistence of the copyright is established, the plaintiff shall be presumed to be the owner of the copyright if he, she, or it claims to be the owner thereof, and the defendant does not put in issue the question of his or her ownership.</p>
            <p>A mere denial of the subsistence of copyright and/or ownership of copyright based on lack of knowledge shall not be sufficient to rebut the presumption.</p>
            <p>SECTION 2. <em>Effect of Registration and Deposit</em>. &mdash; Registration and deposit of a work with the National Library or the IPO shall not carry with it the presumption of ownership of the copyright by the registrant or depositor, nor shall it be considered a condition <em>sine qua non</em> to a claim of copyright infringement.</p>
            <p>SECTION 3. <em>Presumption of Authorship</em>. &mdash; The natural person whose name is indicated on a work in the usual manner as the author shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed to be the author of the work. This presumption applies even if the name is a pseudonym, provided the pseudonym leaves no doubt as to the identity of the author.</p>
            <p>The person or body corporate whose name appears on an audiovisual work in the usual manner shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed to be the maker of said work.</p>
            <p>SECTION 4. <em>International Registration of Works</em>. &mdash; A statement concerning a work, recorded in an international register in accordance with an international treaty to which the Philippines is or may become a party, shall be construed as true until the contrary is proved, except:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Where the statement cannot be valid under Republic Act No. 8293, as amended, or any other law concerning intellectual property; or</li>
                <li>Where the statement is contradicted by another statement recorded in the international register.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">RULE 20</h3>
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"><em>Disposal and/or Destruction of Infringing Goods, Related Objects, or Devices</em></h4>
            <p>SECTION 1. <em>Disposal and/or Destruction of Infringing Goods, Related&nbsp;Objects, or Devices; When to File Motion</em>. &mdash; At any time after the filing of the complaint or information, a motion for the disposal and/or destruction of the seized infringing goods, or materials and implements predominantly used in the infringement, may be filed by the plaintiff, complainant or right-holder before the court.</p>
            <p>There is destruction when the infringing goods are completely destroyed and are put beyond further use. There is disposal when the infringing goods are effectively prohibited from re-entry into the channels of commerce but may be reused for some other lawful purpose.</p>
            <p>In case the infringing goods are counterfeit or pirated, the procedure for their disposal and/or destruction shall be summary in nature with notice to the defendant or the accused to his or her last known address to afford him or her the opportunity to oppose the motion. For this purpose, the lack of authority of the defendant or the accused to exercise any of the rights of the right holder shall be a sufficient ground for the disposal and/or destruction of infringing goods.</p>
            <p>Counterfeit trademark goods mean goods, including packaging, bearing without authorization a trademark which is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and which thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question.</p>
            <p>Pirated copyright goods means any goods which are copies made without the consent of the right-holder or person duly authorized by the right-holder, and which are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right.</p>
            <p>The motion for disposal and/or destruction shall be granted where the violation of the intellectual property right of the owner or right-holder is established.</p>
            <p>In case any genuine issue is raised, such as but not limited to, where the infringement may involve determination of confusing similarity, applicability of fair use or other limitations and exceptions, substantial equivalence, construction of claims, and/or good faith, the court shall continue to receive evidence of the parties during trial in support of their respective claims and defenses, and the disposal and/or destruction of the goods, related objects, or devices shall be resolved after trial.</p>
            <p>SECTION 2. <em>Contents of a Motion for Disposal and/or Destruction</em>. &mdash; The motion for disposal and/or destruction of infringing goods, related objects, or devices shall contain the following:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>An inventory and photographs of the infringing goods, related objects, or devices at the place where the goods are stored;</li>
                <li>The complete address of the place where the infringing goods, related objects, or devices are being stored;</li>
                <li>The classification and nature of the infringing goods, related objects, or devices, whether hazardous or non-hazardous;</li>
                <li>The proposed manner, method and plan of disposal and/or destruction;</li>
                <li>Estimated cost of disposing and/or destruction of the goods, if any; and</li>
                <li>Other facts and evidence relied on in support of the motion.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>SECTION 3. <em>Hazardous Classification of Infringing Goods</em>. &mdash; The infringing goods, related objects, or devices are hazardous when they present:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Short-term acute hazards, such as acute toxicity by ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption, corrosivity or other skin or eye contact hazards, or the risk of fire or explosion;</li>
                <li>Long-term environmental hazards, including chronic toxicity upon repeated exposure, carcinogenicity, which may in some cases result from acute exposure but with a long latent period, resistance to detoxification process such as biodegradation, the potential to pollute underground or surface waters, or aesthetically objectionable properties such as offensive odors; or</li>
                <li>Unreasonable risk and/or injury to health and safety and to the environment.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Hazardous goods, related objects, and devices also include health sensitive infringing goods, which are considered harmful as a result of substandard or incorrect active pharmaceutical ingredients or lack of therapeutic benefits, which can further endanger the public's health.</p>
            <p>Hazardous goods, related objects and devices shall only be subject to destruction. All other infringing goods, related objects and devices shall be subject to disposal and/or destruction.</p>
            <p>SECTION 4. <em>Manner or Method of Disposal and/or Destruction of Infringing&nbsp;Goods</em>. &mdash; The manner or method of disposal and/or destruction of infringing goods, related objects, or devices depends on their nature and circumstances, and whether hazardous or non-hazardous.</p>
            <p>The proposed manner or method of disposal and/or destruction of infringing goods must be compliant with existing laws and regulations.</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>The following methods of destruction may be allowed by the court, depending on the nature and circumstances of the infringing goods, related objects, or devices:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                        <li>Crushing, shredding, and discarding at sanitary landfills;</li>
                        <li>Incineration;</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation; or</li>
                        <li>Other methods that do not pose any risk to the environment or public health and safety.<br /><br /><em>Provided</em> that open burning, or placing these goods in non-sanitary and open landfills shall not be allowed.<br /><br /></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The following methods of disposal may be allowed by the court, depending on the nature and circumstances of the infringing goods, related objects, or devices:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                        <li>Recycling;</li>
                        <li>Humanitarian donation; or</li>
                        <li>Other methods that do not pose any risk to the environment or public health and safety.<br /><br /><em>Provided</em> that the manner of disposal must effectively prevent the re-entry of the infringing goods, related objects, or devices into the channels of commerce.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>SECTION 5. <em>Order of Disposal and/or Destruction of Infringing Goods.</em> &mdash;</p>
            <p>Once the court determines that the motion for disposal and/or destruction is meritorious, it shall issue an order of disposal and/or destruction of infringing goods, related objects, or devices, including but not limited to, sales invoices, other documents evidencing sales, labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles, and advertisements and the like used in the infringing act. The order shall include the manner, method, and plan of disposal and/or destruction, if any.</p>
            <p>Upon issuance of the order, the movant must comply with the following:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>An inventory and photographs of the infringing goods must have been taken before the disposal and/or destruction at the place where the seized infringing goods are stored;</li>
                <li>The taking of the inventory and photographs must be witnessed and attested to by: (1) the defendant, or accused or counsel or agent, or in their absence, an officer of the barangay where the seized infringing goods are stored; (2) the plaintiff, complainant or right-holder, or his or her representative or counsel; (3) the public officer who seized the items or a representative of his or her office; (4) a court officer authorized by the court; and/or (5) authorized representative of the regulatory government agency involved, to supervise the disposal and/or destruction of the infringing goods;</li>

                <li>All infringing marks or features identifying the complainant, plaintiff, or right-holder as the source of the goods shall be removed to the most possible extent; and</li>
                <li>The government entities or charitable institutions to which the infringing goods are to be donated must be properly identified.</li>
            </ol>
