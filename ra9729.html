            <div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Philippines in
                Congress assembled:</i><br><br>SECTION 1. <i>Title.</i> — This Act shall be known as the "Climate Change
                Act of 2009".<br><br>SEC. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy.</i> — It is the policy of the State to afford
                full protection and the advancement of the right of the people to a healthful ecology in accord with the
                rhythm and harmony of nature. In this light, the State has adopted the Philippine Agenda 21 framework
                which espouses sustainable development, to fulfill human needs while maintaining the quality of the
                natural environment for current and future generations.<br><br>Towards this end, the State adopts the
                principle of protecting the climate system for the benefit of humankind, on the basis of climate justice
                or common but differentiated responsibilities and the Precautionary Principle to guide decision-making
                in climate risk management. As a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the
                State adopts the ultimate objective of the Convention which is the stabilization of greenhouse gas
                concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with
                the climate system which should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt
                naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic
                development to proceed in a sustainable manner. As a party to the Hyogo Framework for Action, the State
                likewise adopts the strategic goals in order to build national and local resilience to climate
                change-related disasters.<br><br>Recognizing the vulnerability of the Philippine archipelago and its
                local communities, particularly the poor, women, and children, to potential dangerous consequences of
                climate change such as rising seas, changing landscapes, increasing frequency and/or severity of
                droughts, fires, floods and storms, climate-related illnesses and diseases, damage to ecosystems,
                biodiversity loss that affect the country’s environment, culture, and economy, the State shall cooperate
                with the global community in the resolution of climate change issues, including disaster risk reduction.
                It shall be the policy of the State to enjoin the participation of national and local governments,
                businesses, nongovernment organizations, local communities and the public to prevent and reduce the
                adverse impacts of climate change and, at the same time, maximize the benefits of climate change. It
                shall also be the policy of the State to incorporate a gender-sensitive, pro-children and pro-poor
                perspective in all climate change and renewable energy efforts, plans and programs. In view thereof, the
                State shall strengthen, integrate, consolidate and institutionalize government initiatives to achieve
                coordination in the implementation of plans and programs to address climate change in the context of
                sustainable development.<br><br>Further recognizing that climate change and disaster risk reduction are
                closely interrelated and effective disaster risk reduction will enhance climate change adaptive
                capacity, the State shall integrate disaster risk reduction into climate change programs and
                initiatives.<br><br>Cognizant of the need to ensure that national and subnational government policies,
                plans, programs and projects are founded upon sound environmental considerations and the principle of
                sustainable development, it is hereby declared the policy of the State to systematically integrate the
                concept of climate change in various phases of policy formulation, development plans, poverty reduction
                strategies and other development tools and techniques by all agencies and instrumentalities of the
                government.<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>Definition of Terms.</i> — For purposes of this Act, the following shall

                    <li>"Adaptive capacity" refers to the ability of ecological, social or economic systems to adjust to
                        climate change including climate variability and extremes, to moderate or offset potential
                        damages and to take advantage of associated opportunities with changes in climate or to cope
                        with the consequences thereof.<br></li>
                    <li>"Anthropogenic causes" refer to causes resulting from human activities or produced by human

                        involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts which exceed
                        the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.<br></li>
                    <li>"Disaster risk reduction" refers to the concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through
                        systematic efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through
                        reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of
                        land and the environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events.<br></li>
                    <li>"Gender mainstreaming" refers to the strategy for making women’s as well as men’s concerns and
                        experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of

                        benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. It is the process of assessing the
                        implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies, or
                        programs in all areas and at all levels.<br></li>

                        atmosphere.<br></li>
                    <li>"Greenhouse effect" refers to the process by which the absorption of infrared radiation by the

                        anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all GHG, including ozone-depleting
                        substances and their substitutes.<br></li>
                    <li>"Mitigation potential" shall refer to the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative
                        to emission baselines, for a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon
                        dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced).<br></li>
                    <li>"Sea level rise" refers to an increase in sea level which may be influenced by factors like
                        global warming through expansion of sea water as the oceans warm and melting of ice over land
