                classified.<br><br>Upgrading of water quality shall likewise include undertakings which shall improve
                the water quality of a water body to a classification that will meet its projected or potential use.<br><br>The
                LGUs shall prepare and implement contingency plans and other measures including relocation, whenever
                necessary, for the protection of health and welfare of the residents within potentially affected
                areas.<br><br>SEC. 7. <i>National Sewerage and Septage Management Program</i>. — The Department of
                Public Works and Highways (DPWH), through its relevant attached agencies, in coordination with the

                LGU shall appropriate the necessary land, including the required rights-of-way/road access to the land
                for the construction of the sewage and/or septage treatment facilities.<br><br>Each LGU may raise funds
                to subsidize necessary expenses for the operation and maintenance of sewerage treatment or septage
                facility servicing their area of jurisdiction through local property taxes and enforcement of a service
                fee system.<br><br>SEC. 8. <i>Domestic Sewage Collection, Treatment and Disposal</i>. — Within five (5)

                the government for discharging wastewater into the water bodies. Wastewater charges shall be established
                taking into consideration the following:<br>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>To provide strong economic inducement for polluters to modify their production or management
                        processes or to invest in pollution control technology in order to reduce the amount of water
                        pollutants generated;<br></li>

                </ol>
                The fee shall be based on the net waste load depending on the wastewater charge formula which shall be
                established with due public consultation within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act: <i>Provided</i>,
                That net waste load shall refer to the difference of the initial waste load of the abstracted water and
                the waste load of the final effluent discharge of an industry: <i>Provided, further,</i> That no net
                waste load shall be lower than the initial waste load: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That wastewater charge
                system shall not apply to wastewater from geothermal exploration.<br><br>Industries whose water effluent
                are within standards promulgated pursuant to this Act, shall only be charged with minimal reasonable
                amount which shall be determined by the Department after due public consultation, giving account to
                volumetric rate of discharge and the effluent concentration.<br><br>SEC. 14. <i>Discharge Permits</i>. —
                The Department shall require owners or operators of facilities that discharge regulated effluents
                pursuant to this Act to secure a permit to discharge. The discharge permit shall be the legal
                authorization granted by the Department to discharge wastewater: <i>Provided</i>, That the discharge
                permit shall specify among others, the quantity and quality of effluent that said facilities are allowed
                to discharge into a particular water body, compliance schedule and monitoring requirement.<br><br>As
                part of the permitting procedure, the Department shall encourage the adoption of waste minimization and
                waste treatment technologies when such technologies are deemed cost effective. The Department shall also
                develop procedures to relate the current water quality guideline or the projected water quality
                guideline of the receiving water body/ies with total pollution loadings from various sources, so that
                effluent quotas can be properly allocated in the discharge permits. For industries without any discharge
                permit, they may be given a period of twelve (12) months after the effectivity of the implementing rules
                and regulations promulgated pursuant to this Act, to secure a discharge permit.<br><br>Effluent trading
                may be allowed per management area.<br><br>

                program and project proponents to put up environmental guarantee fund (EGF) as part of the environmental
                management plan attached to the environmental compliance certificate pursuant to Presidential Decree No.
                1586 and its implementing rules and regulations. The EGF shall finance the maintenance of the health of
                the ecosystems and specially the conservation of watersheds and aquifers affected by the development,
                and the needs of emergency response, clean-up or rehabilitation of areas that may be damaged during the
                program's or project's actual implementation. Liability for damages shall continue even after the
                termination of a program or project and, until the lapse of a given period indicated in the
                environmental compliance certificate, as determined by the Department.<br><br>The EGF may be in the form
                of a trust fund, environmental insurance, surety bonds, letters of credit, self-insurance and any other
                instruments which may be identified by the Department. The choice of the guarantee instrument or
                combinations thereof shall depend, among others, on the assessment of the risks involved and financial
                test mechanisms devised by the Department. Proponents required to put up guarantee instruments shall
