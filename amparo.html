            </ol>
            <p>The filing of a petition by the aggrieved party suspends the right of all other authorized parties to file similar petitions.&nbsp; Likewise, the filing of the petition by an authorized party on behalf of the aggrieved party suspends the right of all others, observing the order established herein.</p>
            <p>SEC. 3. <em>Where to File.&mdash;</em>The petition may be filed on any day and at any time with the Regional Trial Court of the place where the threat, act or omission was committed or any of its elements occurred, or with the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court, or any justice of such courts.&nbsp; The writ shall be enforceable anywhere in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>When issued by a Regional Trial Court or any judge thereof, the writ shall be returnable before such court or judge.</p>
            <p>When issued by the Sandiganbayan or the Court of Appeals or any of their justices, it may be returnable before such court or any justice thereof, or to any Regional Trial Court of the place where the threat, act or omission was committed or any of its elements occurred.</p>
            <p>When issued by the Supreme Court or any of its justices, it may be returnable before such Court or any justice thereof, or before the Sandiganbayan or the Court of Appeals or any of their justices, or to any Regional Trial Court of the place where the threat, act or omission was committed or any of its elements occurred.</p>
