Sections 1 and 2 thereof provide:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. Petition for <i>certiorari.</i> - When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, <b>nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law</b>, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 2. Petition for prohibition. - When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or <b>any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law</b>, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts r with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to desist from further proceedings in the action or matter specified therein, or otherwise granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.<br><br>x x x x (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Hence, as a general rule, a motion for reconsideration must first be filed with the lower court prior to resorting to the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition since a motion for reconsideration may still be considered as a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The rationale for the pre-requisite is to grant an opportunity for the lower court or agency to correct any actual or perceived error attributed to it by the re-examination of the legal and factual circumstances of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence states that "[i]t is [the] inadequacy, [and] not the mere absence of all other legal remedies and the danger of failure of justice without the writ, that must usually determine the propriety of <i>certiorari</i> [or prohibition]. A remedy is plain, speedy[,] and adequate if it will promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment, order, or resolution of the lower court or agency, x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>In this light, certain exceptions were crafted to the general rule requiring a prior motion for reconsideration before the filing of a petition for <i>certiorari,</i> which exceptions also apply to a petition for prohibition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> These are: (<i>a</i>) where the order is a patent nullity, as where the court <i>a quo</i> has no jurisdiction; (<i>b</i>) where the questions raised in the <i>certiorari</i> proceedings have been duly raised and passed upon by the lower court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in the lower court; (<i>c</i>) <b>where there is an urgent necessity for the resolution of the question and any further delay would prejudice the interests of the Government</b> or of the petitioner or the subject matter of the action is perishable; (<i>d</i>) where, under the circumstances, a motion for reconsideration would be useless; (<i>e</i>) where petitioner was deprived of due process and there is extreme urgency for relief; (<i>f</i>) where, in a criminal case, relief from an order of arrest is urgent and the granting of such relief by the trial court is improbable; (<i>g</i>) where the proceedings in the lower court are a nullity for lack of due process; (<i>h</i>) where the proceedings were<i> ex parte </i>or in which the petitioner had no opportunity to object; and (<i>i</i>) <b>where the issue raised is one purely of law or where public interest is involved</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is ineluctably clear that the above-highlighted exceptions attend since, for the first time, the question on the authority of the CA - and of this Court, for that matter - to enjoin the implementation of a preventive suspension order issued by the Office of the Ombudsman is put to the fore. This case tests the constitutional and statutory limits of the fundamental powers of key government institutions - namely, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Legislature, and the Judiciary - and hence, involves an issue of transcendental public importance that demands no less than a careful but expeditious resolution. Also raised is the equally important issue on the propriety of the continuous application of the condonation doctrine as invoked by a public officer who desires exculpation from administrative liability. As such, the Ombudsman's direct resort to <i>certiorari </i>and prohibition before this Court, notwithstanding her failure to move for the prior reconsideration of the assailed issuances in CA-G.R. SP No. 139453 and CA-G.R. SP No. 139504 before the CA, is justified.<br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>Albeit raised for the first time by the Ombudsman in her Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> it is nonetheless proper to resolve the issue on the CA's lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the main petition for <i>certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 139453, in view of the well-established rule that a court's jurisdiction over the subject matter may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. The rationale is that subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by law, and the lack of it affects the very authority of the court to take cognizance of and to render judgment on the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> Hence, it should be preliminarily determined if the CA indeed had subject matter jurisdiction over the main CA-G.R. SP No. 139453 petition, as the same determines the validity of all subsequent proceedings relative thereto. It is noteworthy to point out that Binay, Jr. was given the opportunity by this Court to be heard on this issue,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> as he, in fact, duly submitted his opposition through his comment to the Ombudsman's Memorandum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> That being said, the Court perceives no reasonable objection against ruling on this issue.<br><br>The Ombudsman's argument against the CA's lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the main petition, and her corollary prayer for its dismissal, is based on her interpretation of Section 14, RA 6770, or the Ombudsman Act,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> which reads in full:<br><br><blockquote>Section 14. Restrictions. - No writ of injunction shall be issued by any court to delay an investigation being conducted by the Ombudsman under this Act, unless there is a <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the subject matter of the investigation is outside the jurisdiction of the Office of the Ombudsman.<br><br>No court shall hear any appeal or application for remedy against the decision or findings of the Ombudsman, except the Supreme Court, on pure question of law.</blockquote><br>The subject provision may be dissected into two (2) parts.<br><br>The <b>first paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770</b> is a prohibition against any court (except the Supreme Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup>) from issuing a writ of injunction to delay an investigation being conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman. Generally speaking, "[injunction is a judicial writ, process or proceeding whereby a party is ordered to do or refrain from doing a certain act. It may be the main action or merely a provisional remedy for and as an incident in the main action."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> Considering the textual qualifier "to delay," which connotes a suspension of an action while the main case remains pending, the "writ of injunction" mentioned in this paragraph could only refer to injunctions of the provisional kind, consistent with the nature of a provisional injunctive relief.<br><br>The exception to the no injunction policy is when there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the subject matter of the investigation is outside the office's jurisdiction. The Office of the Ombudsman has disciplinary authority over all elective and appointive officials of the government and its subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies, with the exception only of impeachable officers, Members of Congress, and the Judiciary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Nonetheless, the Ombudsman retains the power to investigate any serious misconduct in office allegedly committed by officials removable by impeachment, for the purpose of filing a verified complaint for impeachment, if warranted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> Note that the Ombudsman has concurrent jurisdiction over certain administrative cases which are within the jurisdiction of the regular courts or administrative agencies, but has primary jurisdiction to investigate any act or omission of a public officer or employee who is under the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the <b>second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770</b> provides that no appeal or application for remedy may be heard against the decision or findings of the Ombudsman, with the exception of the Supreme Court on pure questions of law. This paragraph, which the Ombudsman particularly relies on in arguing that the CA had no jurisdiction over the main CA-G.R. SP No. 139453 petition, as it is supposedly this Court which has the sole jurisdiction to conduct a judicial review of its decisions or findings, is vague for two (2) reasons: (<u><b>1</b></u>) it is unclear what the phrase "application for remedy" or the word "findings" refers to; and (<u><b>2</b></u>) it does not specify what procedural remedy is solely allowable to this Court, save that the same be taken only against a pure question of law. The task then, is to apply the relevant principles of statutory construction to resolve the ambiguity.<br><br>"The underlying principle of all construction is that the intent of the legislature should be sought in the words employed to express it, and that when found[,] it should be made to govern, x x x. If the words of the law seem to be of doubtful import, it may then perhaps become necessary to look beyond them in order to ascertain what was in the legislative mind at the time the law was enacted; what the circumstances were, under which the action was taken; what evil, if any, was meant to be redressed; x x x [a]nd where the law has contemporaneously been put into operation, and in doing so a construction has necessarily been put upon it, this construction, especially if followed for some considerable period, is entitled to great respect, as being very probably a true expression of the legislative purpose, and is not lightly to be overruled, although it is not conclusive."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>As an aid to construction, courts may avail themselves of the actual proceedings of the legislative body in interpreting a statute of doubtful meaning.

I think, Mr. President, our Supreme Court has made a distinction between a petition for review and a petition for certiorari; because before, under the 1935 Constitution appeal from any order, ruling or decision of the COMELEC shall be by means of review. But under the Constitution it is now by <i>certiorari</i> and the Supreme Court said that by this change, the court exercising judicial review will not inquire into the facts, into the evidence, because we will not go deeply by way of review into the evidence on record but its authority will be limited to a determination of whether the administrative agency acted without, or in excess of, jurisdiction, or committed a grave abuse of discretion. So, I assume that that is the purpose of this amendment, Mr. President.<br><br><b>Senator Angara</b>. The distinguished Gentleman has stated it so well.<br><br><b>Senator Gonzales</b>.

All right. Is there any objection to the amendment inserting the word <i>CERTIORARI</i> instead of "review"? [<i>Silence</i>] Hearing none, the same is approved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon an assiduous scrutiny of these deliberations, the Court is, however, unconvinced that the provision debated on was Section 14, RA 6770, as the Ombudsman invokes. Note that the exchange begins with the suggestion of Senator Angara to delete the word "review" that comes after the phrase "petition for review" and, in its stead, insert the word "<i>certiorari"</i> so that the "review or appeal from the decision of the Ombudsman would not only be taken on a petition for review, but on <i>certiorari</i>" The ensuing exchange between Senators Gonzales and Angara then dwells on the purpose of changing the method of review from one of a petition for review to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> - that is, to make "the appeal x x x more difficult." Ultimately, the amendment to the change in wording, from "petition for review" to "petition for <i>certiorari</i>" was approved.<br><br>Noticeably, these references to a "petition for review" and the proposed "petition for <i>certiorari</i>" are nowhere to be found in the text of Section 14, RA 6770. In fact, it was earlier mentioned that this provision, particularly its second paragraph, does not indicate what specific procedural remedy one should take in assailing a decision or finding of the Ombudsman; it only reveals that the remedy be taken to this Court based on pure questions of law. More so, it was even commented upon during the oral arguments of this case<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> that there was no debate or clarification made on the current formulation of the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770 per the available excerpts of the Senate deliberations. In any case, at least for the above-cited deliberations, the Court finds no adequate support to sustain the Ombudsman's entreaty that the CA had no subject matter jurisdiction over the main CA-G.R. SP No. 139453 petition.<br><br>On the contrary, it actually makes greater sense to posit that these deliberations refer to another Ombudsman Act provision, namely Section 27, RA 6770. This is because the latter textually reflects the approval of Senator Angara's suggested amendment, <i>i.e</i>., that the Ombudsman's decision or finding may be assailed in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to this Court (fourth paragraph), and further, his comment on the conclusive nature of the factual findings of the Ombudsman, if supported by substantial evidence (third paragraph):<br><br><blockquote>Section 27. <i>Effectivity and Finality of Decisions.&#8212;</i> (1) All provisionary orders of the Office of the Ombudsman are immediately effective and executory.<br><br>A motion for reconsideration of any order, directive or decision of the Office of the Ombudsman must be filed within five (5) days after receipt of written notice and shall be entertained only on any of the following grounds:<br><blockquote>(1) New evidence has been discovered which materially affects the order, directive or decision;<br><br>(2) Errors of law or irregularities have been committed prejudicial to the interest of the movant. The motion for reconsideration shall be resolved within three (3) days from filing: <i>Provided,</i> That only one motion for reconsideration shall be entertained.<br></blockquote>Findings of fact by the Office of the Ombudsman when supported by substantial evidence are conclusive.

However, it should be discerned that the Ombudsman Act was passed way back in 1989<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> and, hence, before the advent of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> At that time, the governing <b>1964 Rules of Court</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> consistent with Section 27, RA 6770, referred to the appeal taken thereunder as a petition for certiorari, thus possibly explaining the remedy's textual denomination, at least in the provision's final approved version:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 45<br><i>Appeal from Court of Appeals to Supreme Court</i><br></center><br>SECTION 1.<i> Filing of Petition with Supreme Court</i>. - A party may appeal by certiorari, from a judgment of the Court of Appeals, by filing with the Supreme Court a<b> petition for<i> certiorari</i></b>, within fifteen (15) days from notice of judgment or of the denial of his motion for reconsideration filed in due time, and paying at the same time, to the clerk of said court the corresponding docketing fee.

To clarify, the phrase "application for remedy," being a generally worded provision, and being separated from the term "appeal" by the disjunctive "or",<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> refers to any remedy (whether taken mainly or provisionally), except an appeal, following the maxim <i>generalia verba sunt generaliter intelligenda</i>: general words are to be understood in a general sense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> By the same principle, the word "findings," which is also separated from the word "decision" by the disjunctive "or", would therefore refer to any finding made by the Ombudsman (whether final or provisional), except a decision.<br><br>The subject provision, however, crafts an <u><b>exception</b></u> to the foregoing general rule. While the specific procedural vehicle is not explicit from its text, it is fairly deducible that the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770 excepts, as the only allowable remedy against "the decision or findings of the Ombudsman," <u><b>a Rule 45 appeal, for the reason that it is the only remedy taken to the Supreme Court on "pure questions of law</b></u>," whether under the 1964 Rules of Court or the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>Rule 45, 1964 Rules of Court</b><br></center><br><center>RULE 45 <br><i>Appeal from Court of Appeals to Supreme Court</i></center><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 2.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>That the remedy excepted in the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770 could be a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the 1964 Rules of Court or the 1997 Rules of Procedure is a suggestion that defies traditional norms of procedure. It is basic procedural law that a Rule 65 petition is based on errors of jurisdiction, and not errors of judgment to which the classifications of (<i>a</i>) questions of fact, (<i>b</i>) questions of law, or (<i>c</i>) questions of mixed fact and law, relate to. In fact, there is no procedural rule, whether in the old or new Rules, which grounds a Rule 65 petition on pure questions of law. Indeed, it is also a statutory construction principle that the lawmaking body cannot be said to have intended the establishment of conflicting and hostile systems on the same subject. Such a result would render legislation a useless and idle ceremony, and subject the laws to uncertainty and unintelligibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> There should then be no confusion that the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770 refers to a Rule 45 appeal to this Court, and no other. In sum, the appropriate construction of this Ombudsman Act provision is that all remedies against issuances of the Office of the Ombudsman are prohibited, except the above-stated Rule 45 remedy to the Court on pure questions of law.<br><br><b>C. <u>Validity of the second paragraph of<br>Section 14, RA 6770</u>.</b><br><br>Of course, the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770's extremely limited restriction on remedies is inappropriate since a Rule 45 appeal -which is within the sphere of the rules of procedure promulgated by this Court - can only be taken against final decisions or orders of lower courts,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[136]</sup></font> and not against "findings" of quasi-judicial agencies. As will be later elaborated upon, Congress cannot interfere with matters of procedure; hence, it cannot alter the scope of a Rule 45 appeal so as to apply to interlocutory "findings" issued by the Ombudsman. More significantly, <b>by confining the remedy to a Rule 45 appeal</b>, the provision takes away the remedy of <i>certiorari</i>, grounded on errors of jurisdiction, in denigration of the judicial power constitutionally vested in courts. In this light, the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770 also increased this Court's appellate jurisdiction, without a showing, however, that it gave its consent to the same. The provision is, in fact, very similar to the fourth paragraph of Section 27, RA 6770 (as above-cited), which was invalidated in the case of <i>Fabian v.

In <i>Ruivivar v.

Desierto</i> arose from the doubt created in the application of Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 (The Ombudsman's Act) and Section 7, Rule III of A.O. No. 7 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman) on the availability of appeal before the Supreme Court to assail a decision or order of the Ombudsman in administrative cases. <b>In <i>Fabian</i>, we invalidated Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 (and Section 7, Rule III of A.O. No. 7 and the other rules implementing the Act) insofar as it provided for appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 from the decisions or orders of the Ombudsman in administrative cases. We held that Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 had the effect, not only of increasing the appellate jurisdiction of this Court without its advice and concurrence in violation of Section 30, Article VI of the Constitution; it was also inconsistent with Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which provides that a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> shall apply only to a review of "judgments or final orders of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Tax Appeals, the Regional Trial Court, or other courts authorized by law."</b> We pointedly said:<br><blockquote>As a consequence of our ratiocination that Section 27 of Republic Act No. 6770 should be struck down as unconstitutional, and in line with the regulatory philosophy adopted in appeals from quasi-judicial agencies in the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, appeals from decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the CA under the provisions of Rule 43.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Since the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770 limits the remedy against "decision or findings" of the Ombudsman to a Rule 45 appeal and thus - similar to the fourth paragraph of Section 27, RA 6770<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> - attempts to effectively increase the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction without its advice and concurrence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> it is therefore concluded that the former provision is also unconstitutional and perforce, invalid. Contrary to the Ombudsman's posturing,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> <i>Fabian</i> should squarely apply since the above-stated Ombudsman Act provisions are <i>in part materia </i>in that they "cover the same specific or particular subject matter,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> that is, the manner of judicial review over issuances of the Ombudsman.<br><br>Note that since the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770 is clearly determinative of the existence of the CA's subject matter jurisdiction over the main CA-G.R. SP No. 139453 petition, including all subsequent proceedings relative thereto, as the Ombudsman herself has developed, the Court deems it proper to resolve this issue <i>ex mero motu </i>(on its own motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup>). This procedure, as was similarly adopted in<i> Fabian,</i> finds its bearings in settled case law:<br><br><blockquote>The conventional rule, however, is that a challenge on constitutional grounds must be raised by a party to the case, neither of whom did so in this case, but that is not an inflexible rule, as we shall explain.<br><br>Since the constitution is intended for the observance of the judiciary and other departments of the government and the judges are sworn to support its provisions, the courts are not at liberty to overlook or disregard its commands or countenance evasions thereof. When it is clear , that a statute transgresses the authority vested in a legislative body, it is the duty of the courts to declare that the constitution, and not the statute, governs in a case before them for judgment.<br><br>Thus, while courts will not ordinarily pass upon constitutional questions which are not raised in the pleadings, the rule has been recognized to admit of certain exceptions. It does not preclude a court from inquiring into its own jurisdiction or compel it to enter a judgment that it lacks jurisdiction to enter. If a statute on which a court's jurisdiction in a proceeding depends is unconstitutional, the court has no jurisdiction in the proceeding, and since it may determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, it necessarily follows that it may inquire into the constitutionality of the statute.<br><br><b>Constitutional questions, not raised in the regular and orderly procedure in the trial are ordinarily rejected unless the jurisdiction of the court below or that of the appellate court is involved in which case it may be raised at any time or on the court's own motion. </b>The Court <i>ex mero motu</i> may take cognizance of lack of jurisdiction at any point in the case where that fact is developed.

Office of the President</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> (<i>Gonzales III</i>), the Court traced the historical underpinnings of the Office of the Ombudsman:<br><br><blockquote>Prior to the 1973 Constitution, past presidents established several Ombudsman-like agencies to serve as the people's medium for airing grievances and for direct redress against abuses and misconduct in the government. Ultimately, however, these agencies failed to fully realize their objective for lack of the political independence necessary for the effective performance of their function as government critic.<br><br>It was under the 1973 Constitution that the Office of the Ombudsman became a constitutionally-mandated office to give it political independence and adequate powers to enforce its mandate. Pursuant to the ( 1973 Constitution, President Ferdinand Marcos enacted Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1487, as amended by PD No. 1607 and PD No. 1630, creating the Office of the Ombudsman to be known as Tanodbayan. It was tasked principally to investigate, on complaint or <i>motu proprio</i>, any administrative act of any administrative agency, including any government-owned or controlled corporation. When the Office of the Tanodbayan was reorganized in 1979, the powers previously vested in the Special Prosecutor were transferred to the Tanodbayan himself. He was given the exclusive authority to conduct preliminary investigation of all cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, file the corresponding information, and control the prosecution of these cases.<br><br>With the advent of the 1987 Constitution, a new Office of the Ombudsman was created by constitutional fiat. <b>Unlike in the 1973 Constitution, its independence was expressly and constitutionally guaranteed.</b> Its objectives are to enforce the state policy in Section 27, Article II and the standard of accountability in public service under Section 1, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution. These provisions read:<br><blockquote>Section 27. The State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption.<br><br>Section 1. Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees must, at all times, be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency; act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>More significantly, <i>Gonzales III </i>explained the broad scope of the office's mandate, and in correlation, the impetus behind its independence:<br><br><blockquote>Under Section 12, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, the Office of the Ombudsman is envisioned to be the "protector of the people" against the inept, abusive, and corrupt in the Government, to function essentially as a complaints and action bureau. This constitutional vision of a Philippine Ombudsman practically intends to make the Ombudsman an authority to directly check and guard against the ills, abuses and excesses , of the bureaucracy. Pursuant to Section 13 (8), Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, Congress enacted RA No. 6770 to enable it to further realize the vision of the Constitution. Section 21 of RA No. 6770 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 21. Official Subject to Disciplinary Authority; Exceptions. - The Office of the Ombudsman shall have disciplinary authority over all elective and appointive officials of the Government and its subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies, including Members of the Cabinet, local government, government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries, except over officials who may be removed only by impeachment or over Members of Congress, and the Judiciary.<br></blockquote>As the Ombudsman is expected to be an "activist watchman," the &lt; Court has upheld its actions, although not squarely falling under the broad powers granted [to] it by the Constitution and by RA No. 6770, if these actions are reasonably in line with its official function and consistent with the law and the Constitution.<br><br>The Ombudsman's broad investigative and disciplinary powers include all acts of malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance of all public officials, including Members of the Cabinet and key Executive officers, during their tenure. To support these broad powers, <u><b>the Constitution saw it fit to insulate the Office of the Ombudsman from the pressures and influence of officialdom and partisan politics and from fear of external reprisal by making it an "independent" office</b></u>, x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Given the scope of its disciplinary authority, the Office of the Ombudsman is a very powerful government constitutional agency that is considered "a notch above other grievance-handling investigative bodies."

Pertinently, the Court observed:<br><br><b>(<u>1</u>)</b> "[T]he independence enjoyed by the Office of the Ombudsman and by the Constitutional Commissions shares certain characteristics - <b>they do not owe their existence to any act of Congress, but are created by the Constitution itself</b>; additionally, they all <b>enjoy fiscal autonomy</b>.

Meanwhile, the validity of Section 8 (2), RA 6770 was maintained insofar as the Office of the Special Prosecutor was concerned since said office was not considered to be constitutionally within the Office of the Ombudsman and is, hence, not entitled to the independence the latter enjoys under the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><br>As may be deduced from the various discourses in <i>Gonzales III</i>, the concept of Ombudsman's independence covers three (3) things:<br><br><b><u>First</u>: creation by the Constitution</b>, which means that the office cannot be abolished, nor its constitutionally specified functions and privileges, be removed, altered, or modified by law, unless the Constitution itself allows, or an amendment thereto is made;<br><br><b><u>Second</u>: fiscal autonomy</b>, which means that the office "may not be obstructed from [its] freedom to use or dispose of [its] funds for purposes germane to [its] functions;<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[168] </sup></font>hence, its budget cannot be strategically decreased by officials of the political branches of government so as to impair said functions; and<br><br><b><u>Third</u>: insulation from executive supervision and control</b>, which means that those within the ranks of the office can only be disciplined by an internal authority.<br><br>Evidently, all three aspects of independence intend to protect the Office of the Ombudsman from <b>political harassment and pressure,</b> so as to free it from the "insidious tentacles of politics."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup><br><br>That being the case, the concept of Ombudsman independence cannot be invoked as basis to insulate the Ombudsman from judicial power constitutionally vested unto the courts.

Instead, through this provision, <b>Congress interfered with a provisional remedy that was created by this Court under its duly promulgated rules of procedure, which utility is both integral and inherent to every court's exercise of judicial power.

Accordingly, the court's acquired jurisdiction, through which it exercises its judicial power, is rendered nugatory. Indeed, the force of judicial power, especially under the present Constitution, cannot be enervated due to a court's inability to regulate what occurs during a proceeding's course. As earlier intimated, when jurisdiction over the subject matter is accorded by law and has been acquired by a court, its exercise thereof should be undipped. To give true meaning to the judicial power contemplated by the Framers of our Constitution, the Court's duly promulgated rules of procedure should therefore remain unabridged, this, even by statute. Truth be told, the policy against provisional injunctive writs in whatever variant should only subsist under rules of procedure duly promulgated by the Court given its sole prerogative over the same.<br><br>The following exchange between Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor F.

SP No. 139453 case.<br><br><b><center>IV.<br></center></b><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, the issue of whether or not the CA gravely abused its jurisdiction in issuing the TRO and WPI in CA-G.R. SP No. 139453 against the preventive suspension order is a persisting objection to the validity of said injunctive writs. For its proper analysis, the Court first provides the context of the assailed injunctive writs.<br><br><b>A. <u>Subject matter of the CA's iniunctive writs is the preventive suspension order.</u></b><br><br>By nature, <b>a preventive suspension order is not a penalty but only a preventive measure</b>. In <i>Quimbo v. Acting Ombudsman Gervacio,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> the Court explained the distinction, stating that <b>its purpose is to prevent the official to be suspended from using his position and the powers and prerogatives of his office to influence potential witnesses or tamper with records which may be vital in the prosecution of the case against him</b>:<br><br><blockquote>Jurisprudential law establishes a clear-cut distinction between<u> suspension as preventive measure</u> and <u>suspension as penalty</u>. The distinction, by considering the purpose aspect of the suspensions, is readily cognizable as they have different ends sought to be achieved.<br><br><b>Preventive suspension is merely a preventive measure, a preliminary step in an administrative investigation. The purpose of the suspension order is to prevent the accused from using his position and the powers and prerogatives of his office to influence potential witnesses or tamper with records which may be vital in the prosecution of the case against him.</b> If after such investigation, the charge is established and the person investigated is found guilty of acts warranting his suspension or removal, then he is suspended, removed or dismissed. This is the penalty.<br><br>That preventive suspension is not a penalty is in fact explicitly provided by Section 24 of Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292) and other Pertinent Civil Service Laws.<br><blockquote>Section. 24. Preventive suspension is not a punishment or penalty for misconduct in office but is considered to be a preventive measure. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Not being a penalty, the period within which one is under preventive suspension is not considered part of the actual penalty of suspension. So Section 25 of the same Rule XIV provides:<br><blockquote>Section 25. The period within which a public officer or employee charged is placed under preventive suspension shall <b>not be considered part of the actual penalty of suspension</b> imposed upon the employee found guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>The requisites for issuing a preventive suspension order are explicitly stated in Section 24, RA 6770:<br><br><blockquote>Section 24. Preventive Suspension. - The Ombudsman or his Deputy may preventively suspend any officer or employee under his authority pending an investigation, <b>if in his judgment the evidence of guilt is strong, <u>and</u> (a) the charge against such officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty; (b) the charges would warrant removal from the service; <u>or</u> (c) the respondent's continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed against him.</b><br><br>The preventive suspension shall continue until the case is terminated by the Office of the Ombudsman but not more than six (6) months, without pay, except when the delay in the disposition of the case by the Office of the Ombudsman is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the respondent, in which case the period of such delay shall not be counted in computing the period of suspension herein provided. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In other words, the law sets forth two (2) conditions that must be satisfied to justify the issuance of an order of preventive suspension pending an investigation, namely:<br><br><blockquote>(<u><b>1</b></u>) The evidence of guilt is strong; and<br><br>(<u><b>2</b></u>) Either of the following circumstances co-exist with the first requirement:<br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) The charge involves dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) The charge would warrant removal from the service; or<br><br>(<i>c</i>) The respondent's continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed against him.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[233]</sup></font><br></blockquote></blockquote><br><b>B. <u>The basis of the CA's injunctive writs is the condonation doctrine</u>.</b><br><br>Examining the CA's Resolutions in CA-G.R. SP No. 139453 would, however, show that the Ombudsman's non-compliance with the requisites provided in Section 24, RA 6770 was not the basis for the issuance of the assailed injunctive writs.<br><br>The CA's March 16, 2015 Resolution which directed the issuance of the assailed TRO was based on the case of <u><b>Governor Garcia, Jr. v.

Thus, since condonation was duly raised by Binay, Jr. in his petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 139453,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[244]</sup></font> the CA did not err in passing upon the same. Note that although Binay, Jr. secondarily argued that the evidence of guilt against him was not strong in his petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 139453,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[245]</sup></font> it appears that the CA found that the application of the condonation doctrine was already sufficient to enjoin the implementation of the preventive suspension order. Again, there is nothing aberrant with this since, as remarked in the same case of <i>Governor Garcia, Jr</i>., if it was established that the acts subject of the administrative complaint were indeed committed during Binay, Jr.'s prior term, then, following the condonation doctrine, he can no longer be administratively charged. In other words, with condonation having been invoked by Binay, Jr. as an exculpatory affirmative defense at the onset, the CA deemed it unnecessary to determine if the evidence of guilt against him was strong, at least for the purpose of issuing the subject injunctive writs.<br><br>With the preliminary objection resolved and the basis of the assailed writs herein laid down, the Court now proceeds to determine if the CA gravely abused its discretion in applying the condonation doctrine.<br><br><b>C. <u>The origin of the condonation doctrine</u>.</b><br><br>Generally speaking, condonation has been defined as "[a] victim's express or implied forgiveness of an offense, [especially] <b>by treating the offender as if there had been no offense.</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup><br><br>The condonation doctrine - which connotes this same sense of complete extinguishment of liability as will be herein elaborated upon - is not based on statutory law. It is a jurisprudential creation that originated from the <u><b>1959 case</b></u> of <i><b>Pascual v. Hon. Provincial Board of Nueva Ecija</b></i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup> (<i>Pascual</i>),<u><i> </i></u><b>which was therefore decided under the 1935 Constitution</b><i>.</i><br><br>In <i>Pascual</i>, therein petitioner, Arturo Pascual, was elected Mayor of San Jose, Nueva Ecija, sometime in November 1951, and was later re-elected to the same position in 1955. <u><b>During his second term</b></u>, or on October 6, 1956, the Acting Provincial Governor filed <u><b>administrative charges</b></u> before the Provincial Board of Nueva Ecija against him for grave abuse of authority and usurpation of judicial functions for acting on a criminal complaint in Criminal Case No. 3556 on December 18 and 20, 1954. In defense, Arturo Pascual argued that he cannot be made liable for the acts charged against him since they were committed during his previous term of office, and therefore, invalid grounds for disciplining him during his second term. The Provincial Board, as well as the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, later decided against Arturo Pascual, and when the case reached this Court on appeal, it recognized that the controversy posed a novel issue - that is, whether or not an elective official may be disciplined for a wrongful act committed by him during his immediately preceding term of office.<br><br>As there was <b>no legal precedent on the issue at that time</b>, the Court, in <i>Pascual,</i> <b>resorted to American authorities</b> and "found that cases on the matter are conflicting due in part, probably, to differences in statutes and constitutional provisions, and also, in part, to a divergence of views with respect to the question of whether the subsequent election or appointment condones the prior misconduct."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup> <u><b>Without going into the variables of these conflicting views and cases</b></u>, it proceeded to state that:<br><br><blockquote><b>The weight of authorities</b> x x x <u><b>seems to incline toward the rule denying the right to remove one from office because of misconduct during a prior term</b></u>, to which we fully subscribe.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[249]</sup></font> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The conclusion is at once problematic since this Court has now uncovered that there is really no established weight of authority in the United States (US) favoring the doctrine of condonation, which, in the words of Pascual, theorizes that an official's re-election denies the right to remove him from office due to a misconduct during a prior term. In fact, as pointed out during the oral arguments of this case, at least seventeen (17) states in the US have abandoned the condonation doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> The Ombudsman aptly cites several rulings of various US State courts, as well as literature published on the matter, to demonstrate the fact that the doctrine is not uniformly applied across all state jurisdictions. Indeed, the treatment is nuanced:<br><br>(<u><b>1</b></u>) For one, it has been widely recognized that the propriety of removing a public officer from his current term or office for misconduct which he allegedly committed in a prior term of office is governed by the language of the statute or constitutional provision applicable to the facts of a particular case (see <i>In Re Removal of Member of Council Coppola</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup> As an example, a Texas statute, on the one hand, expressly allows removal only for an act committed during a present term: "no officer shall be prosecuted or removed from office for any act he may have committed prior to his election to office" (see <i>State ex rel. Rowlings v. Loomis</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma allows removal from office for "acts of commission, omission, or neglect committed, done or omitted during a previous or preceding term of office" (see <i>State v. Bailey</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> Meanwhile, in some states where the removal statute is silent or unclear, the case's resolution was contingent upon the interpretation of the phrase "in office." On one end, the Supreme Court of Ohio strictly construed a removal statute containing the phrase "misfeasance of malfeasance in office" and thereby declared that, in the absence of clear legislative language making, the word "office" must be limited to the single term during which the offense charged against the public officer occurred (see <i>State ex rel. Stokes v. Probate Court of Cuyahoga County</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> Similarly, the Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania decided that the phrase "in office" in its state constitution was a time limitation with regard to the grounds of removal, so that an officer could not be removed for misbehaviour which occurred; prior to the taking of the office (see <i>Commonwealth v. Rudman</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> The opposite was construed in the Supreme Court of Louisiana which took the view that an officer's inability to hold an office resulted from the commission of certain offenses, and at once rendered him unfit to continue in office, adding the fact that the officer had been re-elected did not condone or purge the offense (see<i> State ex rel. Billon v. Bourgeois</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> Also, in the Supreme Court of New York, Apellate Division, Fourth Department, the court construed the words "in office" to refer not to a particular term of office but to an entire tenure; it stated that the whole purpose of the legislature in enacting the statute in question could easily be lost sight of, and the intent of the law-making body be thwarted, if an unworthy official could not be removed during one term for misconduct for a previous one (<i>Newman v. Strobel</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup><br><br>(<u><b>2</b></u>) For another, condonation depended on whether or not the public officer was a successor in the same office for which he has been administratively charged. The "own-successor theory," which is recognized in numerous States as an exception to condonation doctrine, is premised on the idea that each term of a re-elected incumbent is not taken as separate and distinct, but rather, regarded as one continuous term of office. Thus, infractions committed in a previous term are grounds for removal because a re-elected incumbent has no prior term to speak of<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup> (see <i>Attorney-General v. Tufts</i>;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup> <i>State v. Welsh;</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup> <i>Hawkins v. Common Council of Grand Rapids;</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup> <i>Territory v. Sanches;</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup> and <i>Tibbs v. City of Atlanta</i>).<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[263]</sup></font><br><br>(<u><b>3</b></u>) Furthermore, some State courts took into consideration the continuing nature of an offense in cases where the condonation doctrine was invoked. In State <i>ex rel. Douglas v. Megaarden,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> the public officer charged with malversation of public funds was denied the defense of condonation by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, observing that "the large sums of money illegally collected during the previous years are still retained by him." In <i>State ex rel. Beck v. Harvey</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> the Supreme Court of Kansas ruled that "there is no necessity" of applying the condonation doctrine since "the misconduct continued in the present term of office[;] [thus] there was a duty upon defendant to restore this money on demand of the county commissioners." Moreover, in <i>State ex rel. Londerholm v. Schroeder,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> the Supreme Court of Kansas held that "insofar as nondelivery and excessive prices are concerned, x x x there remains a continuing duty on the part of the defendant to make restitution to the country x x x, this duty extends into the present term, and neglect to discharge it constitutes misconduct."<br><br>Overall, the foregoing data clearly contravenes the preliminary conclusion in <i>Pascual </i>that there is a "weight of authority" in the US on the condonation doctrine. In fact, without any cogent exegesis to show that <i>Pascual</i> had accounted for the numerous factors relevant to the debate on condonation, an outright adoption of the doctrine in this jurisdiction would not have been proper.<br><br>At any rate, these US cases are only of persuasive value in the process of this Court's decision-making. "[They] are not relied upon as precedents, but as guides of interpretation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> Therefore, the ultimate analysis is on whether or not the condonation doctrine, as espoused in <i>Pascual,</i> and carried over in numerous cases after, can be held up against prevailing legal norms. Note that the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> does not preclude this Court from revisiting existing doctrine. As adjudged in the case of <i>Belgica</i>, the <i>stare decisis</i> rule should not operate when there are powerful countervailing considerations against its application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup> In other words, stare decisis becomes an intractable rule only when circumstances exist to preclude reversal of standing precedent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup> As the Ombudsman correctly points out, jurisprudence, after all, is not a rigid, atemporal abstraction; it is an organic creature that develops and devolves along with the society within which it thrives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup> In the words of a recent US Supreme Court Decision, "[w]hat we can decide, we can undecide."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court agrees with the Ombudsman that since the time <i>Pascual </i>was decided, the legal landscape has radically shifted. Again, <i>Pascual </i>was a 1959 case decided under the 1935 Constitution, which dated provisions do not reflect the experience of the Filipino People under the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions. Therefore, the plain difference in setting, including, of course, the sheer impact of the condonation doctrine on public accountability, calls for <i>Pascual's</i> judicious re-examination.<br><br><b>D. <u>Testing the Condonation Doctrine.</u></b><br><br><i>Pascual's ratio decidendi</i> may be dissected into three (3) parts:<br><br><b><u><i>First</i></u></b>, the penalty of removal may not be extended beyond the term in which the public officer was elected for each term is separate and distinct:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote><b>Offenses committed, or acts done, during previous term are generally held not to furnish cause for removal</b> and this is especially true where the constitution provides that the penalty in proceedings for removal shall <b>not extend beyond the removal from office, and disqualification from holding office for the term for which the officer was elected or appointed</b>.

Garcia who was administratively charged for his involvement in an anomalous contract for the supply of asphalt for Cebu City, executed only four (4) days before the upcoming elections. The Court ruled that notwithstanding the timing of the contract's execution, the electorate is presumed to have known the petitioner's background and character, including his past misconduct; hence, his subsequent re-election was deemed a condonation of his prior transgressions. More importantly, the Court held that the determinative time element in applying the condonation doctrine should be the time when the contract was perfected; <u><b>this meant that as long as the contract was entered into during a prior term, acts which were done to implement the same, even if done during a succeeding term, do not negate the application of the condonation doctrine in favor of the elective official.</b></u><br><br>(<u><b>6</b></u>) <u><i><b>Salumbides, Jr. v.

Sojor</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[283]</sup> also clarified that <u><b>the condonation doctrine would not apply to appointive officials</b></u> since, as to them, there is no sovereign will to disenfranchise.<br><br>(<u><b>7</b></u>) And finally, the above discussed case of <u><i><b><u>Governor Garcia, Jr.</u></b></i></u> -wherein the Court remarked that it would have been prudent for the appellate court therein to have issued a temporary restraining order against the implementation of a preventive suspension order issued by the Ombudsman in view of the condonation doctrine.<br><br>A thorough review of the cases <b>post-1987</b>, among others, <i>Aguinaldo, Salalima, Mayor Garcia</i>, and <i>Governor Garcia, Jr.</i> - all cited by the CA to justify its March 16, 2015 and April 6, 2015 Resolutions directing the issuance of the assailed injunctive writs - would show that the basis for condonation under the prevailing constitutional and statutory framework was never accounted for. What remains apparent from the text of these cases is that the basis for condonation, as jurisprudential doctrine, was - and still remains - the above-cited postulates of <i>Pascual</i>, which was lifted from rulings of US courts where condonation was amply supported by their own state laws. With respect to its applicability to administrative cases, the core premise of condonation - that is, an elective official's re-election cuts qff the right to remove him for an administrative offense committed during a prior term - was adopted hook, line, and sinker in our jurisprudence largely because the legality of that doctrine was never tested against existing legal norms. As in the US, the propriety of condonation is - as it should be -dependent on the legal foundation of the adjudicating jurisdiction. Hence, the Court undertakes an examination of our current laws in order to determine if there is legal basis for the continued application of the doctrine of condonation.<br><br>The foundation of our entire legal system is the Constitution. It is the supreme law of the land;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[284]</sup> thus, the unbending rule is that every statute should be read in light of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[285]</sup> Likewise, the Constitution is a framework of a workable government; hence, its interpretation must take into account the complexities, realities, and politics attendant to the operation of the political branches of government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[286]</sup><br><br>As earlier intimated, <i>Pascual </i>was a decision promulgated in 1959. Therefore, it was decided within the context of the 1935 Constitution which was silent with respect to public accountability, or of the nature of public office being a public trust. The provision in the 1935 Constitution that comes closest in dealing with public office is Section 2, Article II which states that "[t]he defense of the State is a prime duty of government, and in the fulfillment of this duty all citizens may be required by law to render personal military or civil service."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[287]</sup> Perhaps owing to the 1935 Constitution's silence on public accountability, and considering the dearth of jurisprudential rulings on the matter, as well as the variance in the policy considerations, there was no glaring objection confronting the <i>Pascual </i>Court in adopting the condonation doctrine that originated from select US cases existing at that time.<br><br>With the advent of the 1973 Constitution, the approach in dealing with public officers underwent a significant change. The new charter introduced an entire article on accountability of public officers, found in Article XIII. Section 1 thereof positively recognized, acknowledged, and declared that "<u><b>[p]ublic office is a public trust.</b></u>" Accordingly, "<b>[p]ublic officers and employees shall serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, and shall remain accountable to the people."</b><br><br>After the turbulent decades of Martial Law rule, the Filipino People have framed and adopted the 1987 Constitution, which sets forth in the Declaration of Principles and State Policies in Article II that <b>"[t]he State shall maintain honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective measures against graft and corruption</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[288]</sup> Learning how unbridled power could corrupt public servants under the regime of a dictator, the Framers put primacy on the integrity of the public service by declaring it as a constitutional principle and a State policy. More significantly, the 1987 Constitution strengthened and solidified what has been first proclaimed in the 1973 Constitution by commanding public officers to be accountable to the people <b>at all times</b>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. Public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees <b>must <u>at all times</u> be accountable to the people, serve them with <u>utmost</u> responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency and act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.</b><br></blockquote><br>In <i>Belgica</i>, it was explained that:<br><br><blockquote>[t]he aphorism forged under Section 1, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, which states that "public office is a public trust," is an overarching reminder that every instrumentality of government should exercise their official functions only in accordance with the principles of the Constitution which embodies the parameters of the people's trust. <b>The notion of a public trust connotes accountability</b> x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[289]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The same mandate is found in the Revised Administrative Code under the section of the Civil Service Commission,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[290]</sup> and also, in the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[291]</sup><br><br>For local elective officials like Binay, Jr., the <b>grounds to discipline, suspend or remove an elective local official from office</b> are stated in <b>Section 60 of Republic Act No. 7160</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[292]</sup> otherwise known as the "Local Government Code of 1991" (LGC), which was approved on October 10 1991, and took effect on January 1, 1992:<br><br><blockquote>Section 60. <i>Grounds for Disciplinary Action</i>. - An elective local official may be disciplined, suspended, or removed from office on any of the r following grounds:<br><blockquote>(a) Disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines;<br>(b) Culpable violation of the Constitution;<br>(c) Dishonesty, oppression, misconduct in office, gross negligence, or dereliction of duty;<br>(d) Commission of any offense involving moral turpitude or an offense punishable by at least prision mayor;<br>(e) Abuse of authority;<br>(f) Unauthorized absence for fifteen (15) consecutive working days, except in the case of members of the <i>sangguniang panlalawigan, sangguniang panlunsod, sanggunian bayan</i>, and <i>sangguniang barangay</i>;<br>(g) Application for, or acquisition of, foreign citizenship or residence or the status of an immigrant of another country; and<br>(h) Such other grounds as may be provided in this Code and other laws.</blockquote>An elective local official may be removed from office on the grounds enumerated above by order of the proper court.</blockquote><br>Related to this provision is <b>Section 40 (b) of the LGC</b> which states that <b>those removed from office as a result of an administrative case</b> shall be <b>disqualified from running for any elective local position</b>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 40. Disqualifications. - The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;</b><br><br>x x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In the same sense, Section 52 (a) of the RRACCS provides that the <b><u>penalty of dismissal</u> from service carries the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding public office</b>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 52. - Administrative Disabilities Inherent in Certain Penalties. -<br><ol type="a"><li>The penalty of dismissal shall carry with it cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office, and bar from taking the civil service examinations.</li></ol></blockquote><br>In contrast, Section 66 (b) of the LGC states that the <u><b>penalty of suspension</b></u> shall not exceed the unexpired term of the elective local official nor constitute a bar to his candidacy for as long as he meets the qualifications required for the office. Note, however, that the provision only pertains to the duration of the penalty and its effect on the official's candidacy. <u><b>Nothing therein states that the administrative liability therefor is extinguished by the fact of re-election:</b></u><br><br><blockquote>Section 66. <i>Form and Notice of Decision. </i>- x x x. <br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) The penalty of suspension shall not exceed the unexpired term of the respondent or a period of six (6) months for every administrative offense, nor shall said penalty be a bar to the candidacy of the respondent so suspended as long as he meets the qualifications required for the office.</blockquote><br>Reading the 1987 Constitution together with the above-cited legal provisions now leads this Court to the conclusion that the doctrine of condonation is actually bereft of legal bases.<br><br>To begin with, the concept of <u><b>public office is a public trust and the corollary requirement of accountability to the people at all times</b></u>, as mandated under the 1987 Constitution, is <b>plainly inconsistent</b> with the idea that an elective local official's administrative liability for a misconduct committed during a prior term can be wiped off by the fact that he was elected to a second term of office, or even another elective post. <u><b>Election is not a mode of condoning an administrative offense</b></u>, and there is simply no constitutional or statutory basis in our jurisdiction to support the notion that an official elected for a different term is fully absolved of any administrative liability arising from an offense done during a prior term. In this jurisdiction, <u><b>liability arising from administrative offenses may be condoned bv the President</b></u> in light of Section 19, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution which was interpreted in <i>Llamas v. Orbos</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[293]</sup> to apply to administrative offenses:<br><br><blockquote>The Constitution does not distinguish between which cases executive clemency may be exercised by the President, with the sole exclusion of impeachment cases. By the same token, if executive clemency may be exercised only in criminal cases, it would indeed be unnecessary to provide for the exclusion of impeachment cases from the coverage of Article VII, Section 19 of the Constitution. Following petitioner's proposed interpretation, cases of impeachment are automatically excluded inasmuch as the same do not necessarily involve criminal offenses.<br><br>In the same vein, We do not clearly see any valid and convincing , reason why the President cannot grant executive clemency in administrative cases. It is Our considered view that if the President can grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures in criminal cases, with much more reason can she grant executive clemency in administrative cases, which are clearly less serious than criminal offenses.</blockquote><br>Also, it cannot be inferred from Section 60 of the LGC that the grounds for discipline enumerated therein cannot anymore be invoked against an elective local official to hold him administratively liable once he is re-elected to office. In fact, Section 40 (b) of the LGC precludes condonation since in the first place, an elective local official who is meted with the penalty of removal could not be re-elected to an elective local position due to a direct disqualification from running for such post. In similar regard, Section 52 (a) of the RRACCS imposes a penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding public office as an accessory to the penalty of dismissal from service.<br><br>To compare, some of the cases adopted in <i>Pascual</i> were decided by US State jurisdictions wherein the doctrine of condonation of administrative liability was supported by either a constitutional or statutory provision stating, in effect, that an officer cannot be <b>removed</b> by a misconduct committed during a previous term,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[294]</sup> or that the <b>disqualification to hold the office does not extend beyond the term in which the official's delinquency occurred.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[295]</sup> In one case,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[296]</sup> the absence of a provision against the re-election of an officer removed - unlike Section 40 (b) of the LGC-was the justification behind condonation. In another case,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[297]</sup> it was deemed that condonation through re-election was <b>a policy under their constitution</b> - which adoption in this jurisdiction runs counter to our present Constitution's requirements on public accountability. There was even one case where the doctrine of condonation was not adjudicated upon but only invoked by a party as a ground;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[298]</sup> while in another case, which was not reported in full in the official series, the crux of the disposition was that the evidence of a prior irregularity in no way pertained to the charge at issue and therefore, was deemed to be incompetent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[299]</sup> Hence, owing to either their variance or inapplicability, none of these cases can be used as basis for the continued adoption of the condonation doctrine under our <b>existing laws.</b><br><br>At best, Section 66 (b) of the LGC prohibits <b>the enforcement of the penalty of suspension</b> beyond the unexpired portion of the elective local official's prior term, and likewise allows said official to still run for re-election This treatment is similar to <i>People ex rel Bagshaw v. Thompson</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[300]</sup> and <i>Montgomery v. Novell</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[301]</sup> both cited in <i>Pascual,</i> wherein it was ruled that an officer cannot be <b>suspended</b> for a misconduct committed during a prior term. However, as previously stated, nothing in Section 66 (b) states that the elective local official's administrative liability is extinguished by the fact of re-election. Thus, at all events, no legal provision actually supports the theory that the liability is condoned.<br><br>Relatedly it should be clarified that there is no truth in <i>Pascual's</i> postulation that the courts would be depriving the electorate of their right to elect their officers if condonation were not to be sanctioned. In political law, election pertains to the process by which a particular constituency chooses an individual to hold a public office. In this jurisdiction, there is, again, no legal basis to conclude that election automatically implies condonation. Neither is there any legal basis to say that every democratic and republican state has an inherent regime of condonation. If condonation of an elective official's administrative liability would perhaps, be allowed in this jurisdiction, then the same should have been provided by law under our governing legal mechanisms. May it be at the time of <i>Pascual</i> or at present, by no means has it been shown that such a law, whether in a constitutional or statutory provision, exists. Therefore, inferring from this manifest absence, it cannot be said that the electorate's will has been abdicated.<br><br>Equally infirm is <i>Pascual's</i> proposition that the electorate, when re-electing a local official, are assumed to have done so with knowledge of his life and character, and that they disregarded or forgave his faults or misconduct, if he had been guilty of any. Suffice it to state that <b>no such presumption exists in any statute or procedural rule.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[302]</sup> Besides, it is contrary to human experience that the electorate would have full knowledge of a public official's misdeeds. The Ombudsman correctly points out the reality that most corrupt acts by public officers are shrouded in secrecy, and concealed from the public. <b>Misconduct committed by an elective official is easily covered up, and is almost always unknown to the electorate when they cast their votes</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[303]</sup> At a conceptual level, condonation presupposes that the condoner has actual knowledge of what is to be condoned. <b>Thus, there could be no condonation of an act that is unknown. </b>As observed in <i>Walsh v. City Council of Trenton</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[304]</sup> decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court:<br><br><blockquote>Many of the cases holding that re-election of a public official prevents his removal for acts done in a preceding term of office are reasoned out on the theory of condonation. We cannot subscribe to that theory because condonation, implying as it does forgiveness, connotes knowledge and in the absence of knowledge there can be no condonation. One cannot forgive something of which one has no knowledge.</blockquote><br>That being said, this Court simply finds no legal authority to sustain the condonation doctrine in this jurisdiction. As can be seen from this discourse, it was a doctrine adopted from one class of US rulings way back in 1959 and thus, out of touch from - and now rendered obsolete by - the current legal regime. In consequence, it is high time for this Court to abandon the condonation doctrine that originated from Pascual, and affirmed in the cases following the same, such as <i>Aguinaldo, Salalima, Mayor Garcia,</i> and <i>Governor Garcia, Jr. </i>which were all relied upon by the CA.<br><br>It should, however, be clarified that this Court's abandonment of the condonation doctrine should be <b>prospective </b>in application for the reason that judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution, until reversed, shall form part of the legal system of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[305]</sup> Unto this Court devolves the sole authority to interpret what the Constitution means, and all persons are bound to follow its interpretation. As explained in <i>De Castro v. Judicial Bar Council</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[306]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Judicial decisions assume the same authority as a statute itself and, until authoritatively abandoned, necessarily become, to the extent that they are applicable, the criteria that must control the actuations, not only of those called upon to abide by them, but also of those duty-bound to enforce obedience to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[307]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, while the future may ultimately uncover a doctrine's error, it should be, as <b>a general rule</b>, recognized as "good law" prior to its abandonment. Consequently, the people's reliance thereupon should be respected. The landmark case on this matter is <i>People v. Jabinal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[308]</sup> wherein it was ruled:<br><br><blockquote>[W]hen a doctrine of this Court is overruled and a different view is adopted, the new doctrine should be applied prospectively, and should not apply to parties who had relied on the old doctrine and acted on the faith thereof.</blockquote><br>Later, in <i>Spouses Benzonan v. CA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[309]</sup> it was further elaborated:<br><br><blockquote>[P]ursuant to Article 8 of the Civil Code "judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines." But while our decisions form part of the law of the land, they are also subject to Article 4 of the Civil Code which provides that "laws shall have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided." This is expressed in the familiar legal maxim<i> lex prospicit, non respicit</i>, the law looks forward not backward. The rationale against retroactivity is easy to perceive. The retroactive application of a law usually divests rights that have already become vested or impairs the obligations of contract and hence, is unconstitutional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[310]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Indeed, the lessons of history teach us that institutions can greatly benefit from hindsight and rectify its ensuing course. Thus, while it is truly perplexing to think that a doctrine which is barren of legal anchorage was able to endure in our jurisprudence for a considerable length of time, this Court, under a new membership, takes up the cudgels and now abandons the condonation doctrine.<br><br><b>E. <u>Consequence of ruling</u>.</b><br><br>As for this section of the Decision, the issue to be resolved is <b>whether or not the <u>CA</u> committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction <u>in issuing the assailed injunctive writs.</u></b><br><br>It is well-settled that an act of a court or tribunal can only be considered as with grave abuse of discretion <b>when such act is done in a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.</b> The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[311]</sup> It has also been held that <b>"grave abuse of discretion arises when a lower court or tribunal patently violates the Constitution, the law or existing jurisprudence</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[312]</sup><br><br>As earlier established, records disclose that the CA's resolutions directing the issuance of the assailed injunctive writs were all hinged on cases enunciating the condonation doctrine. To recount, the March 16, 2015 Resolution directing the issuance of the subject TRO was based on the case of <i>Governor Garcia, Jr</i>., while the April 6, 2015 Resolution directing the issuance of the subject WPI was based on the cases of <i>Aguinaldo, Salalima, Mayor Garcia,</i> and again, <i>Governor Garcia, Jr.</i> Thus, by merely following settled precedents on the condonation doctrine, which at that time, unwittingly remained "good law," it cannot be concluded that the CA committed a grave abuse of discretion based on its legal attribution above. Accordingly, the WPI against the Ombudsman's preventive suspension order was correctly issued.<br><br>With this, the ensuing course of action should have been for the CA to resolve the main petition for <i>certiorari </i>in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 139453</b> on the merits. However, considering that the Ombudsman, on October 9, 2015, had already found Binay, Jr. administratively liable and imposed upon him the penalty of dismissal, which carries the accessory penalty of perpetual disqualification from holding public office, for the present administrative charges against him, the said CA petition appears to have been mooted.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[313]</sup></font> As initially intimated, the preventive suspension order is only an ancillary issuance that, at its core, serves the purpose of assisting the Office of the Ombudsman in its investigation. It therefore has no more purpose - and perforce, dissolves - upon the termination of the office's process of investigation in the instant administrative case.<br><br><u><b>F. Exceptions to the mootness principle.</b></u><br><br>This notwithstanding, this Court deems it apt to clarify that the mootness of the issue regarding the validity of the preventive suspension order subject of this case does not preclude any of its foregoing determinations, particularly, its abandonment of the condonation doctrine. As explained in Belgica, '"the moot and academic principle' is not a magical formula that can automatically dissuade the Court in resolving a case. The Court will decide cases, otherwise moot, if: <u><b>first</b></u>, there is a grave violation of the Constitution; <u><b>second</b></u>, the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved; <u><b>third</b></u>, when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and <u><b>fourth</b></u>, the case is capable of repetition yet evading review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[314]</sup> All of these scenarios obtain in this case:<br><br><u><b>First</b></u>, it would be a violation of the Court's own duty to uphold and defend the Constitution if it were not to abandon the condonation doctrine now that its infirmities have become apparent. As extensively discussed, the continued application of the condonation doctrine is simply impermissible under the auspices of the present Constitution which explicitly mandates that public office is a public trust and that public officials shall be accountable to the people at all times.<br><br><u><b>Second</b></u>, the condonation doctrine is a peculiar jurisprudential creation that has persisted as a defense of elective officials to escape administrative liability. It is the first time that the legal intricacies of this doctrine have been brought to light; thus, this is a situation of exceptional character which this Court must ultimately resolve. Further, since the doctrine has served as a perennial obstacle against exacting public accountability from the multitude of elective local officials throughout the years, it is indubitable that paramount public interest is involved.<br><br><u><b>Third</b></u>, the issue on the validity of the condonation doctrine clearly requires the formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public. The issue does not only involve an in-depth exegesis of administrative law principles, but also puts to the forefront of legal discourse the potency of the accountability provisions of the 1987 Constitution. The Court owes it to the bench, the bar, and the public to explain how this controversial doctrine came about, and now, its reasons for abandoning the same in view of its relevance on the parameters of public office.<br><br><u><b>And fourth</b></u>, the defense of condonation has been consistently invoked by elective local officials against the administrative charges filed against them. To provide a sample size, the Ombudsman has informed the Court that "for the period of July 2013 to December 2014 alone, 85 cases from the Luzon Office and 24 cases from the Central Office were dismissed on the ground of condonation. Thus, in just one and a half years, over a hundred cases of alleged misconduct - involving infractions such as dishonesty, oppression, gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct - were placed beyond the reach of the Ombudsman's investigatory and prosecutorial powers."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[315]</sup> Evidently, this fortifies the finding that the case is capable of repetition and must therefore, not evade review.<br><br>In any event, the abandonment of a doctrine is wholly within the prerogative of the Court. As mentioned, it is its own jurisprudential creation and may therefore, pursuant to its mandate to uphold and defend the Constitution, revoke it notwithstanding supervening events that render the subject of discussion moot.<br><br><center><b>V.</b><br></center><br>With all matters pertaining to CA-G.R.

The main opinion has been written well by our esteemed colleague, Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe, who has exhibited her scholarly bent once again. But let me assure my colleagues in the Majority that if I submit this concurrence, I do not mean to diminish in any way or degree the forcefulness and correctness of the justification for the declaration. I simply want to underscore that Section 14 of Republic Act No. 6770 should be struck down for authorizing the undue interference with the prerogatives of the courts of law to adopt whatever means were allowed by law and procedure to exercise their jurisdiction in the cases properly cognizable by them.<br><br>My dissent focuses on the main opinion's re-examination of the doctrine of condonation. This controversy does not call for the revisit of the doctrine, and does not warrant its eventual abandonment. For the Court to persist in the re-examination, as it does now, and to announce its abandonment of the doctrine despite the lack of the premise of justiciability is to indulge in conjecture or in unwarranted anticipation of future controversies. We should refrain from the re-examination.<br><br>The Ombudsman's supplemental petition raised condonation for the first time but only to support her insistence that the CA could not validly rely on the doctrine of condonation to justify its issuance of the injunction. She maintained then that condonation was a matter of defense to be properly raised only in the appropriate administrative proceeding, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>6. It must be further emphasized that the condonation doctrine is irrelevant in the Ombudsman's determination of whether the evidence of guilt is strong in issuing preventive suspension orders. Said doctrine does not go into the heart of subject-matter jurisdiction. Neither can it oust the Ombudsman of her jurisdiction which she has already acquired. Private respondent's claim of condonation doctrine is equally a matter of defense which, like any other defense, could be raised in the proper pleading, could be rebutted, and could be waived.<br><br>As a defense, condonation should be passed upon after a decision on the administrative proceedings, not this early in the proceeding.<br><br>7. The condonation doctrine, however, cannot abate the issuance of a preventive suspension order, precisely because an order of preventive suspension does not render a respondent administratively liable. A respondent may be preventively suspended, yet may be exonerated in the end.<br><br>8. At all events, there is no condonation because private respondent committed the acts subject of the complaint after his re-election in 2013, as was argued by petition in public respondent Court of Appeals.<br><br>9. As mentioned earlier, there is no condonation. The assailed act (i.e. payment), by private respondent's own admission during the proceedings before public respondent Court of Appeals, took place during the period of June and July 2013, which was after his re-election in May 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>The Ombudsman again discussed the doctrine of condonation at some length in her Memorandum as the fourth and last argument presented on the issue of the propriety of the temporary restraining order and the writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> She reiterated, however, that the doctrine was only a matter of defense that was relevant only in imposing an administrative penalty on the respondent public elective official, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>165. Thus, in deciding that the evidence of respondent Binay's guilt is strong, petitioner did not take into consideration the so-called "condonation doctrine" the way respondent Court of Appeals did in its Third Resolution. The condonation doctrine is applicable and relevant only to the imposition of an administrative penalty, not to the issuance of a preventive suspension, the latter being merely a preliminary step in an administrative investigation.<br><br>166. Since a preventive suspension does not hold a public officer liable, it will not be affected by any "condonation" that the electorate may extend to the public officer. Verily, for purposes of aiding an investigation, a public officer may be preventively suspended even as, ultimately, he or she will be exonerated from administrative liability due to the condonation doctrine. CONDONATION IS A MATTER OF DEFENSE - to be positively alleged and to be weighed according to the evidence - during the administrative proceedings, and not at the very preliminary stage thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>I agree with the Ombudsman. The question of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA could be settled not by re-examining and overturning the doctrine of condonation but by reference to Section 24 of the Republic Act No. 6770. It would be plain error for us to determine whether the Court of Appeals (CA) gravely abused its discretion or not on the basis of the doctrine of condonation.<br><br>The general investigatory power of the Ombudsman is decreed by Section 13 (1), Article XI of the 1987 Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> while her statutory mandate to act on administrative complaints is founded on Section 19 of Republic Act No. 6770, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Section 19. Administrative complaints. &#8212; The Ombudsman shall act on all complaints relating, but not limited, to acts or omissions which:<br><br>1. Are contrary to law or regulation;<br><br>2. Are unreasonable, unfair, oppressive or discriminatory;<br><br>3. Are inconsistent with the general course of an agency's functions, though in accordance with law;<br><br>4. Proceed from a mistake of law or an arbitrary ascertainment of facts;<br><br>5. Are in the exercise of discretionary powers but for an improper purpose; or<br><br>6. Are otherwise irregular, immoral or devoid of justification.<br></blockquote><br>In line with the power to investigate administrative cases, the Ombudsman is vested with the authority to preventively suspend respondent public officials and employees pursuant to Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6770, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 24. Preventive Suspension. &#8212; The Ombudsman or his Deputy may preventively suspend any officer or employee under his authority pending an investigation, if in his judgment the evidence of guilt is strong, and (a) the charge against such officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty; (b) the charges would warrant removal from the service; or (c) the respondent's continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed against him.<br><br>The preventive suspension shall continue until the case is terminated by the Office of the Ombudsman but not more than six (6) months, without pay, except when the delay in the disposition of the case by the Office of the Ombudsman is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the respondent, in which case the period of such delay shall not be counted in computing the period of suspension herein provided.</blockquote><br>It is important to note, however, that the Ombudsman has no authority to issue the preventive suspension order in connection with criminal investigations of government officials or employees because such authority rests in the courts in which the criminal cases are filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Under Section 24, <i>supra</i>, two requisites must concur to render the preventive suspension order valid. The first requisite is unique because it can be satisfied in only one way, which is that the evidence of guilt is strong in the judgment of the Ombudsman or the Deputy Ombudsman. But the second requisite may be satisfied in three different ways, namely: (1) that the offense charged involves dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty; or (2) the charge would warrant removal from the service; or (3) the respondent's continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed against him or her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Respondent Jejomar Erwin S. Binay, Jr., along with other officers and employees of the City of Makati, were administratively charged in the Office of the Ombudsman with grave misconduct, serious dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In her joint order dated March 10, 2015, the Ombudsman stated that the requisites for the issuance of the preventive suspension order against Binay, Jr. and his co&shy;respondents were satisfied, specifically:<br><br>The <b>first</b> requisite is present in these cases, as shown by the supporting evidence attached as Annexes to the Complaint. These Annexes include, among other things, sworn statements of <i>alleged</i> losing bidders and of some members of the Makati City BAC attesting to the irregularities in the subject procurement; documents negating the purported publication of bids; and disbursement vouchers, checks, and official receipts showing disbursement of public funds by the city government.<br><br>As regard the <b>second</b> requisite, all the circumstances enumerated therein are likewise present. The Complaint charges respondents with Grave Misconduct, Serious Dishonesty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. If proven true, they constitute grounds for removal from public service under the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Moreover, since the respondents' respective positions give them access to public records and influence on possible witnesses, respondents' continued stay in office may prejudice the cases filed against them. Thus, their preventive <i>suspension without pay for a period of six (6) months</i> is in order.<br><br>When he assailed the preventive suspension order by petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the CA, Binay, Jr. alleged that the preventive suspension order was illegal and issued with grave abuse of discretion because: (1) it contravened well-settled jurisprudence applying the doctrine of condonation; and (2) evidence of his guilt was not strong. He prayed that a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction be issued to enjoin the implementation of the preventive suspension order.<br><br>The CA heeded Binay, Jr.'s prayer for injunctive reliefs chiefly on the basis of the doctrine of condonation. In the resolution promulgated on March 16, 2015, the CA, citing the pronouncement in <i>Garcia, Jr. v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; granted Binay, Jr.'s application for the temporary restraining order, holding as follows:<br><br></http:></http:><blockquote><http: definitions.uslegal.com="" i="" inherent-powers-doctrine=""><http: www.ombudsman.gov.ph="" index.php?home="l&amp;pressId=NzE3">In <i>Garcia v.

This is because if it were established that the acts subject of the administrative complaint were indeed committed during petitioner's prior term, then following settled jurisprudence, he can no longer be administratively charged. It further declared imperative on the part of the appellate court, as soon as it was apprised of the said considerable grounds, to issue an injunctive writ so as not to render moot, nugatory and ineffectual the resolution of the issues in the <i>certiorari</i> petition.

It pointed out that the basic purpose of a restraining order is to preserve the status quo until the hearing of the application for preliminary injunction. That, it is a preservative remedy for the protection of substantive rights and interests.

Guingona, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> explained:<br><br><blockquote><i>Garcia</i> was simply an echo of teachings in <i>Joson v. Cowl of Appeals</i> (G.R. No. 160652, February 13, 2006) where the High Court declared that suspension from office of an elective official would deprive the electorate of the services of the person they have voted into office.<br><br>Along this line, the concept of condonation, as advocated by petitioner and opposed by public respondent Ombudsman, will assume resonance.<br><br>Premised on <i>Aguinaldo, Salalima</i> and <i>Garcia</i>, petitioner asserted that the public respondent Ombudsman can hardly impose preventive suspension of petitioner, given his election in 2010 and re-election in 2013 as Makati City Mayor, relative to his perceived illegal participation in anomalous activities for the Makati City Hall Building II project from 2007 to 2013.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>To reiterate, there was no disagreement that petitioner was elected in 2010 and re-elected as City Mayor of Makati in 2013. The acts constitutive of the charges in the Complaint pertained to events from November 8, 2007, when City Ordinance No. 2007-A-015 appropriated P1,240,000,000.00 as supplemental budget for 2007. From this budget, P400,000,000.00 was allocated for the parking building. It was allegedly during this time that a Negotiated Contract for the architectural and engineering services were negotiated and approved. Disbursements allegedly favored Hilmarc and MANA amidst irregularities in the bidding process during the term of petitioner as City Mayor of Makati.<br><br>Yet, to subscribe to public respondent Ombudsman's submission that condonation can only be appreciated by the investigating body <i>after</i> it is ventilated as an exculpation by petitioner and <i>considered solely</i> by public respondent, following the exercise of its investigatory power, will ignore the Court's constitutional power and duty to evaluate the factual and legal foundations for, nay, impediments to, a preventive suspension in an administrative case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>In my view, however, the CA erroneously banked on the pronouncements in <i>Garcia, Jr., Joson III, Aguinaldo</i>, and <i>Salalima</i> to espouse the doctrine of condonation as the basis to issue the injunctive writs under its resolutions promulgated on March 16, 2015 and April 6, 2015. In both <i>Aguinaldo</i> and <i>Salalima,</i> the Court applied the doctrine of condonation to avoid the imposition of administrative liability upon re-elected public officials. Specifically, the Court held in <i>Aguinaldo</i> that:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioner's re-election to the position of Governor of Cagayan has rendered the administrative case pending before Us moot and academic. It appears that after the canvassing of votes, petitioner garnered the most number of votes among the candidates for governoer of Cagayan province, xxx<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Clearly then, the rule is that a public official cannot be removed for administrative misconduct committed during a prior term, since his re&shy;election to office operates as a condonation of the officer's previous misconduct to the extent of cutting off the right to remove him therefor. The foregoing rule, however, finds no application to <i>criminal</i> cases pending against petitioner for acts he may have committed during the failed coup.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>while in <i>Salalima</i>, the Court maintained that:<br><br><blockquote>xxx [A]ny administrative liability which petitioner Salalima might have incurred in the execution of the retainer contract in O.P. Case No. 5469 and the incidents related therewith and in the execution on 6 March 1992 of a contract for additional repair and rehabilitation works for the Tabaco Public Market in O.P. Case No. 5450 are deemed extinguished by his reelection in the 11 May 1992 synchronozed elections. So are the liabilities, if any, of petitioner members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan ng Albay,who signed Resolution No. 129 authorizing petitioner Salalima to enter into the retainer contract in question and who were reelected in the 1992 elections. This is, however, without prejudice to the institution of appropriate civil and criminal cases as may be warranted by the attendant circumstances, xxx<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>It is clear to me that, based on the language and the factual milieu of Aguinaldo and Salalima, which both cited <i>Pascual v. Provincial Board of Nueva Ecija</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and of other akin rulings,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> condonation shall apply only in case of the re-election of a public officer who is sought to be permanently removed from office as a result of his misconduct, not while such public officer is undergoing investigation. Condonation necessarily implies that the condoned act has already been found to have been committed by the public officer. Hence, condonation applies to the penalty or punishment imposed <i>after the conduct of an administrative investigation</i>. Under the circumstances, the pronouncements in<i> Aguinaldo, Salalima</i> and the others could not be applicable to the preventive suspension order issued to Binay, Jr. pending his administrative investigation because preventive suspension pending the conduct of an investigation was not yet a penalty in itself, but a mere measure of precaution to enable the disciplining authority to investigate the charges by precluding the respondent from influencing the witnesses against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>It is worth emphasis that preventive suspension is distinct from the penalty of suspension. The former is imposed on a public official during the investigation while the latter, as a penalty, is served after the <i>final</i> disposition of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The former is not a punishment or penalty for misconduct in office, but a merely preventive measure, or a preliminary step in the administrative investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>As I see it, the CA misconstrued the milieu in <i>Garcia, Jr.</i> and<i> Joson III </i>as an application of the doctrine of condonation. The Court notably stated in <i>Garcia, Jr.</i> and <i>Joson III</i> that "suspension from office of an elective official would deprive the electorate of the services of the person they voted into office" in the context of determining the propriety of the issuance of the preventive suspension order. In other words, the statement only served to remind the Ombudsman to issue the preventive suspension orders with utmost caution in view of the gravity of the effects of suspending an incumbent elective local official. Hence, <i>Garcia, Jr. </i>and <i>Joson III</i> did not apply the doctrine of condonation.<br><br>I further underscore that the CA was then only resolving Binay, Jr.'s application for injunctive reliefs against the preventive suspension order issued by the Ombudsman. At that point, the CA's application of the doctrine of condonation was irrelevant and unnecessary.<br><br>A preliminary injunction is an order granted at any stage of an action prior to the judgment or final order requiring a party or a court, agency or a person to refrain from a particular act or acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The requirements for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction or temporary restraining ordern are clearly set forth in Section 3, Rule 58 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The sole objective of the writ of preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo until the merits of the case can be heard fully. The writ of preliminary injunction is generally based solely on initial and incomplete evidence;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> hence, it should not determine the merits of a case, or decide controverted facts, for, being a preventive remedy, it only seeks to prevent threatened wrong, further injury, and irreparable harm or injustice until the rights of the parties can be settled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As held in <i>Saulog v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> it is sufficient that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x for the court to act, there must be an existing basis of facts affording a present right which is directly threatened by an act sought to be enjoined. And while a clear showing of the right claimed is necessary, its existence need not be conclusively established. In fact, the evidence to be submitted to justify preliminary injunction at the hearing thereon need not be conclusive or complete but need only be a sampling intended merely to give the court an idea of the justification for the preliminary injunction pending the decision of the case on the merits. This should really be so since our concern here involves only the proprietary of the preliminary injunction and not the merits of the case still pending with the trial court.<br><br><b>Thus, to be entitled to the writ of preliminary injunction, the private respondent needs only to show that it has the ostensible right to the final relief prayed for in its complaint </b>x x x. (bold emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>By relying on the doctrine of condonation, therefore, the CA went beyond the parameters for determining whether or not to issue the injunctive writ. To recall, Binay, Jr. had filed his petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the CA primarily to assail the validity of the preventive suspension order. What was raised for the CA to determine was whether or not the Ombudsman satisfactorily complied with the requisites imposed by Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6770 to establish that Binay, Jr. and his co-respondents had the ostensible right to the final relief prayed for in their petition, which was the nullification or lifting of the preventive suspension order. In this regard, the CA plainly exceeded its jurisdiction.<br><br>In the meanwhile, the Ombudsman found Binay, Jr. administratively liable, and dismissed him from the service. By such dismissal, the questions raised against the CA's issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction against the Ombudsman were rendered moot and academic. I join the Majority in saying that the preventive suspension order, being an ancillary issuance, was dissolved upon the Ombudsman's resolution of the administrative charges on the merits. Thus, to dwell on the preventive suspension of Binay, Jr. and his co-respondents any further would be superfluous, for, as the Court said in <i>Philippine Savings Bank v. Senate Impeachment Court</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is a rule of universal application that courts of justice constituted to pass upon substantial rights will not consider questions in which no actual interests are involved; they decline jurisdiction of moot cases. And where the issue has become moot and academic, there is no justiciable controversy, so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value. <b>There is no actual substantial relief to which petitioners would be entitled and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition</b>.</blockquote><br>In short, the Court should excuse itself from exercising jurisdiction because the main case, the administrative proceeding against the respondents, has already been decided by the Ombudsman on the merits.<br><br><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, I VOTE to PARTIALLY GRANT</b> the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, and, accordingly, <b>SET ASIDE</b> the Resolution promulgated on April 6, 2015 by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>I further <b>VOTE</b> to <b>DISSOLVE</b> the writ of preliminary injunction issued on April 8, 2015 in C.A.-G.R.
