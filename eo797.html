                internal structure of the Administration shall be established along the major
                functional areas corresponding to welfare services, placement and market
                development, and regulation. Each principal substantive subdivision shall be
                headed by a Director who shall be appointed by the President upon the
                recommendation of the Minister. The Administration shall have its own support
                staff.</p>
