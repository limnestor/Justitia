                <H3>ESTABLISHING A PROBATION SYSTEM, APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.</H3>
                <H4>(as amended by R.A. No. 10707)</H4>
            </CENTER>
            <BR><BR><div align="justify"><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> one of the major goals of the government is to
            establish a more enlightened and humane correctional system that will promote
            the reformation of offenders and thereby reduce the incidence of recidivism;
            <p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> the confinement of all offenders in prisons and
                other institutions with rehabilitation programs constitutes an onerous drain on
                the financial resources of the country; and
            </p><p><strong>WHEREAS,</strong> there is a need to provide a less costly
                alternative to the imprisonment of offenders who are likely to respond to
                individualized, community-based treatment program;
            </p><p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS,</strong> President of the
                Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution, do hereby
                order and decree the following:
            </p><p><strong>SECTION 1.</strong> <em>Title and Scope of the Decree.</em>&#8212;This
                Decree shall be known as the Probation Law of 1976. It shall apply to all
                offenders except those entitled to the benefits under the provisions of
                Presidential Decree numbered Six Hundred and Three and similar laws.
            </p><p><strong>SEC. 2.</strong> <em>Purpose.</em>&#8212;This Decree shall be interpreted
                so as to:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p>(a) promote the correction and rehabilitation of an offender by providing him
                    with individualized treatment; </p>
                <p>(b) provide an opportunity for the reformation of a penitent offender which
                    might be less probable if he were to serve a prison sentence; and </p>
                <p>(c) prevent the commission of offenses. </p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>SEC. 3.</strong> <em>Meaning of Terms</em>.&#8212;As used in this Decree,
                the following shall, unless the context otherwise requires; be construed thus:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p>(a) "Probation" is a disposition under which a defendant, after conviction
                    and sentence, is released subject to conditions imposed by the court and to the
                    supervision of a probation officer. </p>
                <p>(b) "Probationer" means a person placed on probation. </p>
                <p>(c) "Probation Officer" means one who investigates for the court a referral
                    for probation or supervises a probationer or both. </p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>SEC. 4.</strong> <em>Grant of Probation.</em>&#8212;Subject to the provisions of this Decree, the trial court may, after it shall have convicted and sentenced a defendant for a probationable penalty and upon application by said defendant within the period for perfecting an appeal, suspend the execution of the sentence and place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as it may deem best. No application for probation shall be entertained or granted if the defendant has perfected the appeal from the judgment of conviction: <i>Provided</i>, That when a judgment of conviction imposing a non-probationable penalty is appealed or reviewed, and such judgment is modified through the imposition of a probationable penalty, the defendant shall be allowed to apply for probation based on the modified decision before such decision becomes final. The application for probation based on the modified decision shall be filed in the trial court where the judgment of conviction imposing a non-probationable penalty was rendered, or in the trial court where such case has since been re-raffled. In a case involving several defendants where some have taken further appeal, the other defendants may apply for probation by submitting a written application and attaching thereto a certified true copy of the judgment of conviction.
            </p>
            <p>The trial court shall, upon receipt of the application filed, suspend the execution of the sentence imposed in the judgment.</p>
            <p>This notwithstanding, the accused shall lose the benefit of probation should he seek a review of the modified decision which already imposes a probationable penalty.</p>
            <p>Probation may be granted whether the sentence imposes a term of imprisonment or a fine only. The filing of the application shall be deemed a waiver of the right to appeal.
            </p>
            <p>An order granting or denying probation shall not be appealable.</p>

            <p><strong>SEC. 5. </strong><em>Post-sentence Investigation.</em>&#8212;No person
                shall be placed on probation except upon prior investigation by the probation
                officer and a determination by the court that the ends of justice and the best
                interest of the public as well as that of the defendant will be served thereby.
            </p><p><strong>SEC. 6. </strong><em>Form of Investigation Report.</em>&#8212;The
                investigation report to be submitted by the probation officer under Section 5
                hereof shall be in the form prescribed by the Probation Administrator and
                approved by the Secretary of Justice.
            </p><p><strong>SEC. 7.</strong> <em>Period for Submission of Investigation
                Report.</em>&#8212; The probation officer shall submit to the court the investigation
                report on a defendant not later than sixty days from receipt of the order of
                said court to conduct the investigation. The court shall resolve the petition
                for probation not later than live days after receipt of said, report.
            </p><p>Pending submission of the investigation report and the resolution of the
                petition, the defendant, may be allowed on temporary liberty under his bail
                filed in the criminal case; Provided, That, in ease where no bail was filed or
                that the defendant is incapable of filing one, the court may allow the release
                of the defendant on recognizance to the custody of a responsible member of the
                community who shall guarantee his appearance whenever required by the court.
            </p><p><strong>SEC. 8. </strong><em>Criteria for Placing an Offender on
                Probation.</em>&#8212; In determining whether an offender may be placed on probation,
                the court shall consider all information relative to the character, antecedents,
                environment, mental and physical condition of the offender, and available
                institutional and community resources. Probation shall be denied if the court
                finds that:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p>(a) the offender is in need of correctional treatment that can be provided
                    most effectively by his commitment to an institution; or </p>
                <p>(b) there is an undue risk that during the period of probation the offender
                    will commit another crime; or </p>
                <p>(c) probation will depreciate the seriousness of the offense committed.
                </p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>SEC. 9.</strong> <em>Disqualified Offenders.</em>&#8212;The benefits of
                this Decree shall not be extended to those:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p>(a) sentenced to serve a maximum term of imprisonment of more than six (6) years;
                </p>
                <p>(b) convicted of any crime against the national security; </p>
                <p>(c) who have previously been convicted by final judgment of an offense punished by imprisonment of more than six (6) months and one (1) day and/or a fine of more than one thousand pesos (P1,000.00); </p>
                <p>(d) who have been once on probation under the provisions of this Decree; and
                </p>
                <p>(e) who are already serving sentence at the time the substantive provisions of this Decree became applicable pursuant to Section 33 hereof.
                </p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>SEC. 10.</strong> <em>Conditions of Probation.</em>&#8212;Every probation
                order issued by the court shall contain conditions requiring that the
                probationer shall:
            </p><blockquote>
                <p>(a) present himself to the probation officer designated to undertake his
                    supervision at such place as may be specified in the order within seventy-two
                    hours from receipt of said order; </p>
                <p>(b) report to the probation officer at least once a month at such time and
                    place as specified by said officer. The court may also require the probationer
                    to: </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>(a) cooperate with a program of supervision; </p>
                    <p>(b) meet his family responsibilities; </p>
                    <p>(c) devote himself to a specific employment and not to change said employment
                        without the prior written approval of the probation officer; </p>
                    <p>(d) undergo medical, psychological or psychiatric examination and treatment
                        and enter and remain in a specified institution, when required for that purpose;
                    </p>
                    <p>(e) pursue a prescribed secular study or vocational </p>

                    <p>(h) abstain from drinking intoxicating beverages to excess; </p>
                    <p>(i) permit the probation officer or an authorized social worker to visit his
                        home and place of work; </p>
                    <p>(j) reside at premises approved by it and not to change his residence without
                        its prior written approval; or </p>
                    <p>(k) satisfy any other condition related to the rehabilitation of the
                        defendant and not unduly restrictive of his liberty or incompatible with his
                        freedom of conscience. </p></blockquote></blockquote>
            <p><strong>SEC. 11</strong> <em>Effectivity of Probation Order</em>.&#8212;A probation
                order shall take effect upon its issuance, at which time the court shall inform
                the offender of the consequences thereof and explain that upon his failure to
                comply with any of the conditions prescribed in the said order or his commission
                of another offense, he shall serve the penalty imposed for the offense under
                which he was placed on probation.
            </p><p><strong>SEC. 12.</strong> <em>Modification of Conditions of Probation.</em>&#8212;
                During the period of probation, the court may, upon application of either the
                probationer or the probation officer, revise or modify the conditions or period
                of probation. The court shall notify either the probationer or the probation
                officer of the filing of such an application so as to give both parties an
                opportunity to be heard thereon. The court shall inform in writing the probation
                officer and the probationer of any change in the period or conditions of
                probation.
            </p><p><strong>SEC. 13.</strong> <em>Control and Supervision of
                Probationer.</em>&#8212;The probationer and his probation program shall be under the
                control of the court who placed him on probation subject to actual supervision
                and visitation by a probation officer. Whenever a probationer is permitted to
                reside in a place under the jurisdiction of another court, control over him
                shall be transferred to the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of
                that place, and in such a case, a copy of the probation order, the investigation
                report and other pertinent records shall be furnished said Executive Judge.
                Thereafter, the Executive Judge to whom jurisdiction over the probationer is
                transferred shall have the power with respect to him that was previously
                possessed by the court which granted the probation.
            </p><p><strong>SEC. 14.</strong><em> Period of Probation.</em>&#8212;
            </p><blockquote>
                <p>(a) The period of probation of a defendant sentenced to a term of
                    imprisonment of not more than one year shall not exceed two years, and in all
                    other cases, said Period shall not exceed six years. </p>
                <p>(b) When the sentence imposes a fine only and the offender is made to serve'
                    subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, the period of probation shall not
                    be less than nor be more than twice the total number of days of subsidiary
                    imprisonment as computed at the rate established in Article thirty-nine of the
                    Revised Penal Code, as amended. </p></blockquote>
            <p><strong>SEC. 15.</strong> <em>Arrest of Probationer; Subsequent
                Disposition.</em>&#8212;At any time during probation, the court may issue a warrant
                for the arrest of a probationer for violation of any of the conditions of
                probation. The probationer, once arrested and detained, shall immediately be
                brought before the court for a hearing, which may be informal and summary, of
                the violation charged. The defendant may be admitted to bail pending such
                hearing. In such a case, the provisions regarding release on bail of persons
                charged with a crime shall be applicable to probationers arrested under this
                provisions. If the violation is established, the court may revoke or continue
                his probation and modify the conditions thereof. If revoked, the court shall
                order the probationer to serve the sentence originally imposed. An order
                revoking the grant of probation or modifying the terms and conditions thereof
                shall not be appealable.
            </p><p><strong>SEC. 16. </strong><em>Termination of Probation.</em>&#8212;After the period of probation and upon consideration of the report and recommendation of the probation officer, the court may order the final discharge of the probationer upon finding that he has fulfilled the terms and conditions of his probation and thereupon the case is deemed terminated.
            </p><p>The final discharge of the probationer shall operate to restore to him all civil rights lost or suspended as a result of his conviction and to totally extinguish his criminal liability as to the offense for which probation was granted.
            </p>
            <p>The probationer and the probation officer shall each be furnished with a copy of such order.</p>
            <p><strong>SEC. 17.</strong> <em>Confidentiality of Records.</em>&#8212;The
                investigation report and the supervision history of a probationer obtained under
                this Decree shall be privileged and shall not be disclosed directly o,r
                indirectly to anyone other than the Probation Administration or the court
                concerned, except that the court, in its discretion, may permit the probationer
