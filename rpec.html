            <p>SEC. 10<em>.

            <p>SEC. 12. <em>Payment of filing and other legal fees.</em>&mdash;The payment of filing and other legal fees by the plaintiff shall be deferred until after judgment unless the plaintiff is allowed to litigate as an indigent. It shall constitute a first lien on the judgment award.</p>
            <p>For a citizen suit, the court shall defer the payment of filing and other legal fees that shall serve as first lien on the judgment award.</p>
            <p>SEC. 13. <em>Service of summons, orders and other court processes</em>.&mdash;The summons, orders and other court processes may be served by the sheriff, his deputy or other proper court officer or for justifiable reasons, by the counsel or representative of the plaintiff or any suitable person authorized or deputized by the court issuing the summons.</p>

            <p>The summons shall be served on the defendant, together with a copy of an order informing all parties that they have fifteen (15) days from the filing of an answer, within which to avail of interrogatories to parties under Rule 25 of the Rules of Court and request for admission by adverse party under Rule 26, or at their discretion, make use of depositions under Rule 23 or other measures under Rules 27 and 28.</p>
            <p>Should personal and substituted service fail, summons by publication shall be allowed.&nbsp; In the case of juridical entities, summons by publication shall be done by indicating the names of the officers or their duly authorized representatives.</p>
            <p>SEC. 14. <em>Verified answer</em>.&mdash;Within fifteen (15) days from receipt of summons, the defendant shall file a verified answer to the complaint and serve a copy thereof on the plaintiff.&nbsp; The defendant shall attach affidavits of witnesses, reports, studies of experts and all evidence in support of the defense.</p>
            <p>Affirmative and special defenses not pleaded shall be deemed waived, except lack of jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Cross-claims and compulsory counterclaims not asserted shall be considered barred.&nbsp; The answer to counterclaims or cross-claims shall be filed and served within ten (10) days from service of the answer in which they are pleaded.</p>
            <p>SEC. 15.&nbsp; <em>Effect of failure to answer</em>.&mdash;Should the defendant fail to answer the complaint within the period provided, the court shall declare defendant in default and upon motion of the plaintiff, shall receive evidence <em>ex parte</em> and render judgment based thereon and the reliefs prayed for.</p>

            <p>The court shall schedule the pre-trial and set as many pre-trial conferences as may be necessary within a period of two (2) months counted from the date of the first pre-trial conference.</p>
            <p>SEC. 2. <em>Pre-trial brief</em>.&mdash;At least three (3) days before the pretrial, the parties shall submit pre-trial briefs containing the following:</p>
