            mortgage is a conditional sale of personal property as security for the
            payment of a debt, or the performance of some other obligation
            specified therein, the condition being that the sale shall be void upon
            the seller paying to the purchaser a sum of money or doing some other
            act named. If the condition is performed according to its terms the
            mortgage and sale immediately become void, and the mortgagee is thereby
            divested of his title.<br /><br />Sec. 4.<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1pt;"></span> Validity. – A chattel mortgage shall not
            be valid against any person except the mortgagor, his executors or
            administrators, unless the possession of the property is delivered to
            and retained by the mortgagee or unless the mortgage is recorded in the
            office of the register of deeds of the province in which the mortgagor
            resides at the time of making the same, or, if he resides without the
            Philippine Islands, in the province in which the property is situated:
            Provided, however, That if the property is situated in a different
            province from that in which the mortgagor resides, the mortgage shall
            be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of both the province
            in which the mortgagor resides and that in which the property is
            situated, and for the purposes of this Act the city of Manila shall be
            deemed to be a province.<br /><br />Sec. 5.<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1pt;"></span> Form. – A chattel mortgage shall be deemed
            to be sufficient when made substantially in accordance with the

            the same, in the presence of two witnesses, who shall sign the mortgage
            as witnesses to the execution thereof, and each mortgagor and
            mortgagee, or, in the absence of the mortgagee, his agent or attorney,

            and investigation, to identify the same.<br /><br />If the property mortgaged be large cattle," as defined by section one
            of Act Numbered Eleven and forty-seven, and the amendments thereof,

            brands, class, sex, age, knots of radiated hair commonly known as
            remolinos, or cowlicks, and other marks of ownership as described and
            set forth in the certificate of ownership of said animal or animals,
            together with the number and place of issue of such certificates of
            ownership.<br /><br />If growing crops be mortgaged the mortgage may contain an agreement
            stipulating that the mortgagor binds himself properly to tend, care for
            and protect the crop while growing, and faithfully and without delay to
            harvest the same, and that in default of the performance of such duties
            the mortgage may enter upon the premises, take all the necessary
            measures for the protection of said crop, and retain possession thereof
            and sell the same, and from the proceeds of such sale pay all expenses
            incurred in caring for, harvesting, and selling the crop and the amount
            of the indebtedness or obligation secured by the mortgage, and the
            surplus thereof, if any shall be paid to the mortgagor or those
            entitled to the same.<br /><br />A chattel mortgage shall be deemed to cover only the property described
            therein and not like or substituted property thereafter acquired by the
            mortgagor and placed in the same depository as the property originally
            mortgaged, anything in the mortgage to the contrary notwithstanding.<br /><br />Sec. 8.<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1pt;"></span> Failure of mortgagee to discharge the
            mortgage. – If the mortgagee, assign, administrator, executor, or
            either of them, after performance of the condition before or after the
            breach thereof, or after tender of the performance of the condition, at
            or after the time fixed for the performance, does not within ten days
            after being requested thereto by any person entitled to redeem,
            discharge the mortgage in the manner provided by law, the person
            entitled to redeem may recover of the person whose duty it is to
            discharge the same twenty pesos for his neglect and all damages
            occasioned thereby in an action in any court having jurisdiction of the
            subject-matter thereof.<br /><br />Sec. 9-12.<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1pt;"></span> (Repealed by Art. 367, Revised Penal Code.) <br /><br />Sec. 13.<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1pt;"></span> When the condition of a chattel mortgage
            is broken, a mortgagor or person holding a subsequent mortgage, or a
            subsequent attaching creditor may redeem the same by paying or
            delivering to the mortgagee the amount due on such mortgage and the
            reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such breach of condition
            before the sale thereof. An attaching creditor who so redeems shall be
            subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee and entitled to foreclose the
            mortgage in the same manner that the mortgagee could foreclose it by
            the terms of this Act.<br /><br />Sec. 14.<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1pt;"></span> Sale of property at public auction;
            Officer's return; Fees; Disposition of proceeds. – The mortgagee, his
            executor, administrator, or assign, may, after thirty days from the
            time of condition broken, cause the mortgaged property, or any part
            thereof, to be sold at public auction by a public officer at a public
            place in the municipality where the mortgagor resides, or where the
            property is situated, provided at least ten days' notice of the time,
            place, and purpose of such sale has been posted at two or more public
            places in such municipality, and the mortgagee, his executor,
            administrator, or assign, shall notify the mortgagor or person holding
            under him and the persons holding subsequent mortgages of the time and
            place of sale, either by notice in writing directed to him or left at
            his abode, if within the municipality, or sent by mail if he does not
            reside in such municipality, at least ten days previous to the sale.<br /><br />The officer making the sale shall, within thirty days thereafter, make
            in writing a return of his doings and file the same in the office of
            the register of deeds where the mortgage is recorded, and the register
            of deeds shall record the same. The fees of the officer for selling the
            property shall be the same as in the case of sale on execution as
            provided in Act Numbered One hundred and ninety, and the amendments
            thereto, and the fees of the register of   deeds for registering
            the officer's return shall be taxed as a part of the costs of sale,
            which the officer shall pay to the register of deeds. The return shall
            particularly describe the articles sold, and state the amount received
            for each article, and shall operate as a discharge of the lien thereon
            created by the mortgage. The proceeds of such sale shall be applied to
            the payment, first, of the costs and expenses of keeping and sale, and
            then to the payment of the demand or obligation secured by such
            mortgage, and the residue shall be paid to persons holding subsequent
            mortgages in their order, and the balance, after paying the mortgages,
            shall be paid to the mortgagor or person holding under him on demand.<br /><br />If the sale includes any "large cattle," a certificate of transfer as
            required by section sixteen of Act Numbered Eleven hundred and
            forty-seven shall be issued by the treasurer of the municipality
                where the sale was held to the purchaser thereof.<br /><br />Sec. 15.<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1pt;"></span> Superseded by Sections 115 and 116 of the Property Registration Decree<br /><br />Sec. 16.<span style="color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1pt;"></span> This Act shall take effect on August
            first, nineteen hundred and six.<br /><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Enacted, July 2, 1906.</span><br style="font-style:italic;" /><br /><small style="font-style:italic;"></td> </tr></tbody></table>
