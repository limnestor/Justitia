                There is hereby created a Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) which shall be of the same level as the Court of Appeals, possessing all the inherent powers of a Court of Justice, and shall consist of a Presiding Justice and eight (8) Associate Justices. The incumbent Presiding Judge and Associate Judges shall continue in office and bear the new titles of Presiding Justice and Associate Justices. The Presiding Justice and the two (2) most Senior Associate Justices, all of whom are incumbent, shall serve as chairmen of the three (3) Divisions. The other three (3) incumbent Associate Justices and the three (3) additional Associate Justices shall serve as members of the Divisions. The additional three (3) Justices as provided herein and the succeeding members of the Court shall be appointed by the President upon nomination by the Judicial and Bar Council. The Presiding Justice shall be so designated in his appointment, and the Associate Justices shall have precedence according to the date of their respective appointments, or when the appointments of two (2) or more of them shall bear the same date, according to the order in which their appointments were issued by the President. They shall have the same qualifications, rank, category, salary, emoluments and other privileges, be subject to the same inhibitions and disqualifications, and enjoy the same retirement and other benefits as those provided for under existing laws for the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals.<p/>
                Whenever the salaries of the Presiding Justice and the Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals are increased, such increases in salaries shall be deemed correspondingly extended to and enjoyed by the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the CTA.<p/>
            The Presiding Justice and Associate Justices shall hold office during good behavior, until they reach the age of seventy (70), or become incapacitated to discharge the duties of their office, unless sooner removed for the same causes and in the same manner provided by law for members of the judiciary of equivalent rank.

            Five (5) Justices shall constitute a quorum for sessions en banc and two (2) Justices for sessions of a Division. Provided, That when the required quorum cannot be constituted due to any vacancy, disqualification, inhibition, disability, or any other lawful cause, the Presiding Justice shall designate any Justice of other Divisions of the Court to sit temporarily therein.<p/><p/>
            The affirmative votes of five (5) members of the Court en banc shall be necessary to reverse a decision of a Division but a simple majority of the Justices present necessary to promulgate a resolution or decision in all other cases or two (2) members of a Division, as the case may be, shall be necessary for the rendition of a decision or resolution in the Division Level.

The Clerk of Court and the Division Clerks of Court shall have the same rank, privileges, salary, emoluments, retirement and other benefits as those provided for the Clerk of Court and Division Clerks of Court of the Court of Appeals, respectively.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 4. &#9;<i>Other subordinate employees</i>.</b> - The Supreme Court shall appoint all officials and employees of the CTA, in accordance with the Civil Service Law. The Supreme Court shall fix their salaries and prescribe their duties.</p>

Justices of the Court shall be disqualified from sitting in any case on the same grounds provided under Rule one hundred thirty-seven of the Rules of Court for the disqualification of judicial officers. No person who has once served in the Court in a permanent capacity, either as Presiding Justice or as Associate Justice thereof, shall be qualified to practice as counsel before the Court for a period of one (1) year from his retirement or resignation.</p>
