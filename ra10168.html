                    pesos (Php500,000.00) nor more than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00). </p>
                <p>SEC. 9. <em>Offense by a Juridical Person, Corporate Body or Alien. &#8211; </em>If the offender is a
                    corporation, association, partnership or any juridical person, the penalty shall be imposed upon the
                    responsible officers, as the case may be, who participated in, or allowed by their gross negligence,
                    the commission of the crime or who shall have knowingly permitted or failed to prevent its
                    commission. If the offender is a juridical person, the court may suspend or revoke its license. If

                    facilitating the financing of terrorism or acts of terrorism as defined herein. </p>
                <p>The AMLC may also enlist the assistance of any branch, department, bureau, office, agency or
                    instrumentality of the government, including government-owned and -controlled corporations in

                    the AMLC is hereby authorized to inquire into or examine deposits and investments with any banking
                    institution or non-bank financial institution and their subsidiaries and affiliates without a court
                    order. </p>
                <p>SEC. 11. <em>Authority to Freeze. </em>&#8211; The AMLC, either upon its own initiative or at the
                    request of the ATC, is hereby authorized to issue an <em>ex parte </em>order to freeze without
                    delay: (a) property or funds that are in any way related to financing of terrorism or acts of
                    terrorism; or (b) property or funds of any person, group of persons, terrorist organization, or
                    association, in relation to whom there is probable cause to believe that they are committing or
                    attempting or conspiring to commit, or participating in or facilitating the commission of financing
                    of terrorism or acts of terrorism as defined herein. </p>
                <p>The freeze order shall be effective for a period not exceeding twenty (20) days. Upon a petition
                    filed by the AMLC before the expiration of the period, the effectivity of the freeze order may be
                    extended up to a period not exceeding six (6) months upon order of the Court of Appeals: <em>Provided, </em>That
                    the twenty-day period shall be tolled upon filing of a petition to extend the effectivity of the
                    freeze order. </p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, the AMLC, consistent with the Philippines &#8217;
                    international obligations, shall be authorized to issue a freeze order with respect to property or
                    funds of a designated organization, association, group or any individual to comply with binding
                    terrorism-related Resolutions, including Resolution No. 1373, of the UN Security Council pursuant to
                    Article 41 of the Charter of the UN. Said freeze order shall be effective until the basis for the
                    issuance thereof shall have been lifted. During the effectivity of the freeze order, an aggrieved
                    party may, within twenty (20) days from issuance, file with the Court of Appeals a petition to
                    determine the basis of the freeze order according to the principle of effective judicial
                    protection. </p>
                <p>However, if the property or funds subject of the freeze order under the immediately preceding
                    paragraph are found to be in any way related to financing of terrorism or acts of terrorism
                    committed within the jurisdiction of the Philippines , said property or funds shall be the subject
                    of civil forfeiture proceedings as hereinafter provided. </p>
                <p>SEC. 12. <em>Exceptions for Investigative Requirements. </em>&#8211; Notwithstanding the immediately
                    preceding provision, the AMLC may decide to defer the issuance of a freeze order for as long as
                    necessary for any specific investigative/prosecutorial purposes. </p>
                <p>SEC. 13. <em>Humanitarian Exemptions. </em>&#8211; The person whose property or funds have been
                    frozen under the first paragraph of Section 11 may withdraw such sums as the court determines to be
                    reasonably needed for monthly family needs and sustenance including the services of counsel and the
                    family medical needs of such person. </p>
                <p>The person whose property or funds have been frozen under the third paragraph of Section 11 may
                    withdraw such sums as the AMLC determines to be reasonably needed for monthly family needs including
                    the services of counsel and the family medical needs of such person. </p>

                    charged of the offenses defined and penalized herein shall not be construed as a violation of this
                    Act, thereby exempting the PAO from any liability. </p>
                <p>SEC. 15. <em>Publication of Designation. </em>&#8211; The Department of Foreign Affairs with respect
                    to designation under Section 3 (e) (1) of this Act, and the ATC with respect to designation under
                    Section 3 (e) (2) and (3) and Section 11 of this Act, shall publish a list of the designated persons

                <p>Each respective agency or authority shall ensure that information on procedures established in rules
                    and regulations issued pursuant to this Act for delisting, unfreezing and exemptions for basic,
                    necessary or extraordinary expenses shall likewise be made available in their respective

                    Freeze Order. </em>&#8211; Upon receipt of the notice of a freeze order, the covered institutions
                    and/or relevant government agencies shall immediately preserve the subject property or funds in
                    accordance with the order of the AMLC and shall forthwith serve a copy of the notice of the freeze

                    the administrative sanctions that the AMLC may impose on the erring covered institution. </p>

                    4 and offenses punishable under Sections 5, 6, and 7 of this Act shall be predicate offenses to

                    preferential application, the criminal provisions of this Act shall apply: (a) to individual persons
                    who, although physically outside the territorial limits of the Philippines, commit, conspire or plot

                    Philippines; (b) to individual persons who, although physically outside the territorial limits of
                    the Philippines, commit any of the said crimes on board Philippine ship or Philippine airship; (c)

                    over the offense. </p>

                    forth under this Act. </p>
                <p>SEC. 21. <em>Applicability of the Revised Penal Code. </em>&#8211; The provisions of Book I of the

                <p>SEC. 23. <em>Separability Clause. </em>&#8211; If, for any reason, any provision of this Act is
                    declared invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining provisions not affected thereby shall continue
                    to be in force and effect. </p>
