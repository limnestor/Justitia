            <center><b>ATTACHMENTS</b></center>

            <center><h1>Guidelines on the Use of Gender-Fair Language in the Judiciary and Gender-Fair Courtroom Etiquette</h1></center>

            <p><b>WHEREAS</b>, Article II, Section 11 of the 1987 Constitution recognizes the policy of the State to value the dignity of every human person and guarantee full respect for human rights;</p>

            <p><b>WHEREAS</b>, Article II, Section 14 of the 1987 Constitution recognizes the role of women in nation-building, with the State mandate to ensure the fundamental equality of women and men before the law;</p>

            <p><b>WHEREAS</b>, to attain such equality, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7192, otherwise known as "Women in Development and Nation Building Act," requiring all government departments and agencies to review and revise all their regulations, circulars, issuances, and procedures to remove gender bias;</p>

            <p><b>WHEREAS</b>, under Section 13 of Republic Act No. 9710, or "The Magna Carta for Women," gender-sensitive language shall be used at all times to further the avowed policy of abolishing the unequal structures and practices that perpetuate discrimination and inequality in society;</p>

            <p><b>WHEREAS</b>, the Supreme Court issued Administrative Circular No. 82-2006 dated 19 September 2006 on the use of Gender-Fair Language in the Judiciary, adopting <i>in toto</i> Memorandum Circular No. 12, S. 2005 of the Civil Service Commission entitled "Use of Non-Sexist Language in All Official Documents, Communications and Issuances";</p>

            <p><b>WHEREAS</b>, the said Administrative Circular was further reiterated by the Supreme Court through Memorandum Order No. 90-2021 on 24 September 2021;</p>

            <p><b>WHEREAS</b>, in Republic Act No. 11313, the State recognized the dignity of every human person, and penalized various acts, including the use of words that ridicule on the basis of sex, gender or sexual orientation, identify and/or expression such as sexist, homophobic, and transphobic statements and slurs;</p>

            <p><b>WHEREAS</b>, the said Memorandum Circular must be expanded, reinforced, supplemented and contextualized for wider and more nuanced adaptation and application in the Judiciary's multi-faceted systems and processes;</p>

            <p><b>NOW, THEREFORE</b>, upon the recommendation of the Committee on Gender Responsiveness in the Judiciary, the Court <i>en banc</i> <b>RESOLVES TO ADOPT</b> the "<b>GUIDELINES ON THE USE OF GENDER-FAIR LANGUAGE IN THE JUDICIARY AND GENDER-FAIR COURTROOM ETIQUETTE.</b>"</p>

            <center><h2>Guidelines on the Use of Gender-Fair Language in the Judiciary</h2></center>

            <p>Language is the most widely used medium of communication, both written and oral. It articulates consciousness (thoughts, feelings, needs), reflects culture (encodes and transmits cultural meanings and values), and affects socialization (the absorption of cultural assumptions and biases affects the younger society members' behavior and beliefs).<sup>1</sup> Hence, the need to recognize the importance of transforming language from traditional usage to a more liberating one, that which is gender-sensitive.<sup>2</sup></p>

            <p>Sexist language "devalues members of one sex, almost invariably women, and thus fosters gender inequality."<sup>3</sup> Indeed, it has been pointed out that "[t]he use of gendered generics can communicate subtle sexism, distract, and create ambiguity."<sup>4</sup></p>

            <p>Our courts are courts of evidence, and its power to take judicial notice of matters is limited.<sup>5</sup> Therefore, courts cannot and should not perpetuate gender stereotypes, which rest on unfounded generalizations regarding the characteristics and roles of binary and non-binary genders,<sup>6</sup> but indisputably influence the perspectives of the judges and litigants alike. This is evident with respect to matters at issue before the courts, as well as in the language the courts employ in adjudication.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "[T]oday, we simply cannot be stuck to the Maria Clara stereotype of a demure and reserved Filipino woman. We, should stay away from such mindset and accept the realities of a woman's dynamic role in society today; she who has over the years transformed into a strong and confidently intelligent and beautiful person, willing to fight for her rights. In this way, we can evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception. It is important to weed out these unnecessary notions because an accused may be convicted solely on the testimony of the victim, provided of course, that the testimony is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. Thus, in order for us to affirm a conviction for rape, we must believe beyond reasonable doubt the version of events narrated by the victim."

            <p>In <i>Falcis III v. Civil Registrar General</i>,<sup>65</sup> the Supreme Court observed:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "In the realm of the social sciences, a great number of 20th-century psychoanalysts unfortunately viewed homosexuality as something pathological. This influenced the field of American psychiatry in the mid-20th century that when the American Psychological Association published the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1952, 'it listed all the conditions psychiatrists then considered to be a mental disorder. DSM-I classified 'homosexuality' as a 'sociopathic personality disturbance.'
                <br><br>
                It was not until the research of biologist Alfred Kinsey and other scientists challenged the orthodoxy that homosexuality was delisted as a mental disorder in the next iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual x x x.
                <br><br>
                However, the official removal of homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental disorder was not the last word on the subject. Homosexuality was still considered a 'disorder,' and it was not until several years later that all traces of what was mistakenly thought to be a 'disease' would be completely removed from the manual x x x.
                <br><br>
                Homosexuality was officially removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1986. x x x.
                <br><br>
                The American Psychological Association's revision marked the 'beginning of the end of organized medicine's official participation in the social stigmatization of homosexuality' as similar movements also followed. In 1990, the World Health Organization removed homosexuality per se from the International Classification of Diseases."

            <center><h2>Gender-Fair Courtroom Etiquette</h2></center>

            <p>1. <b>Address all lawyers neutrally as "counsel" or "attorney."</b> Refrain from referring to female lawyers as "lady" or "female" counsel or male lawyers as "gentleman" or "male" counsel. Instead, use their surnames after the word "Atty." (ex., Atty. Santos) or just use "Counsel." Refer to the Public Prosecutor and Public Attorney by name (ex., Prosecutor Paz, Public Attorney Ramos). Refrain from referring to the Public Prosecutor or Public Attorney as "Madam Fiscal" or "Mister Fiscal," or "the Lady Public Attorney" or "the Gentleman Public Attorney." In making inquiries, use a question that applies to everyone, such as, "Will all attorneys please identify themselves to the court?"</p>

            <p>2. <b>Address all non-lawyer litigants, witnesses, and other court users as "Mister," "Mrs.," or "Miss," "Sir" or "Ma'am" as appropriate.</b> Refrain from referring to litigants as "Madam Plaintiff" or "Mister Plaintiff," but just "Plaintiff" or just refer to them by name (ex., Mr. Santos, Miss Dantes). Refrain from referring to witnesses as "Mister Witness" or "Madam Witness." Instead, use their name (ex., Mr. Cruz, Mrs. De Leon).</p>

            <p>3. <b>When addressing minors, refrain from using words like "little boy," "little girl," "<i>hijo/iho</i>," "<i>hija/iha</i>."</b> Instead, use their first names or nicknames, if known, to put them at ease and to avoid the diminutive references.</p>

            <p>4. <b>Refrain from any act or proceeding that will demean, embarrass, humiliate, or degrade any party by reason of gender.</b> For example, in conducting arraignment in criminal cases, if the Information contains allegations that would expose either the offended party or the accused to ridicule or debasement related to their gender, the public should be excluded and the reading of the Information should be done only in the presence of the parties and their respective counsel, unless the reading of the Information is waived. Similarly, reception of testimonial evidence that might invite gender-revilement or gender-bias, or has a tendency of exposing any party to embarrassment or degradation by reason of gender, should be restricted to the parties and their counsel.</p>

            <p>5. <b>Refrain from perpetuating gender stereotypes.</b> For example, do not make one counsel go first with her cross-examination because she is female, saying "ladies first." Or do not make a male court attendee stand up to give up his seat for a female court attendee by saying "<i>lalaki ka naman</i>." Comments, jokes, and remarks with sexual content, or jokes and remarks that insinuate gender stereotypes, should not be tolerated in the courtroom setting. For example, remarking that a lawyer appears to be more organized because she is a woman is unacceptable.</p>

            <p>6. <b>Avoid comments on or insinuations related to physical appearance that may draw unwanted attention to one's gender.</b> For example, calling attention to a lawyer's pregnancy while she is conducting business may affect how others perceive her.</p>

            <p>7. <b>Justices, judges, court personnel, and litigants are all responsible in observing gender-fair language and etiquette in the courts.</b> Gender insensitive acts or omissions committed in one's presence should be courteously but discreetly corrected in the most respectful manner.</p>
