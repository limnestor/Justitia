It shall apply in all criminal proceedings and non-criminal proceedings involving child witnesses.</p>

            <dir>
                <p align="justify">(a) A &quot;child witness&quot; is any person who at the time of giving testimony is below the age of eighteen (18) years. In child abuse cases, a child includes one over eighteen (18) years but is found by the court as unable to fully take care of himself or protect himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.</p>

                <p align="justify">(d) &quot;Record regarding a child&quot; or &quot;record&quot; means any photograph, videotape, audiotape, film, handwriting, typewriting, printing, electronic recording, computer data or printout, or other memorialization, including any court document, pleading, or any copy or reproduction of any of the foregoing, that contains the name, description, address, school, or any other personal identifying information about a child or his family and that is produced or maintained by a public agency, private agency, or individual.</p>

                <p align="justify">(g) &quot;Best interests of the child&quot; means the totality of the circumstances and conditions as are most congenial to the survival, protection, and feelings of security of the child and most encouraging to his physical, psychological, and emotional development. It also means the least detrimental available alternative for safeguarding the growth and development of the child.</p>
                <p align="justify">(h) &quot;Developmental level&quot; refers to the specific growth phase in which most individuals are expected to behave and function in relation to the advancement of their physical, socio-emotional, cognitive, and moral abilities.</p>
                <p align="justify">(i) &quot;In-depth investigative interview&quot; or &quot;disclosure interview&quot; is an inquiry or proceeding conducted by duly trained members of a multidisciplinary team or representatives of law enforcement or child protective services for the purpose of determining whether child abuse has been committed.</p>
            </dir>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 5. <i>Guardian ad litem</i>.</b> - </p>
            <dir>
                <p align="justify">(a) The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a child who is a victim of, accused of, or a witness to a crime to promote the best interests of the child. In making the appointment, the court shall consider the background of the guardian ad litem and his familiarity with the judicial process, social service programs, and child development, giving preference to the parents of the child, if qualified. The guardian ad litem may be a member of the Philippine Bar. A person who is a witness in any proceeding involving the child cannot be appointed as a guardian ad litem.</p>
                <p align="justify">(b) The guardian ad litem:</p>
                <dir>
                    <p align="justify">(1) Shall attend all interviews, depositions, hearings, and trial proceedings in which a child participates;</p>

                    <p align="justify">(6) Shall assist the child and his family in coping with the emotional effects of crime and subsequent criminal or non-criminal proceedings in which the child is involved;</p>
                    <p align="justify">(7) May remain with the child while the child waits to testify;</p>

                </dir>
                <p align="justify">(c) The guardian ad litem shall be notified of all proceedings but shall not participate in the trial. However, he may file motions pursuant to sections 9, 10, 25, 26, 27 and 31(c). If the guardian ad litem is a lawyer, he may object during trial that questions asked of the child are not appropriate to his developmental level.</p>
                <p align="justify">(d) The guardian ad litem may communicate concerns regarding the child to the court through an officer of the court designated for that purpose. </p>
                <p align="justify">(e) The guardian ad litem shall not testify in any proceeding concerning any information, statement, or opinion received from the child in the course of serving as a guardian ad litem, unless the court finds it necessary to promote the best interests of the child.</p>
                <p align="justify">(f) The guardian ad litem shall be presumed to have acted in good faith in compliance with his duties described in sub-section (b).</p>
            </dir>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 6. <i>Competency</i>.</b> -  Every child is presumed qualified to be a witness. However, the court shall conduct a competency examination of a child, motu proprio or on motion of a party, when it finds that substantial doubt exists regarding the ability of the child to perceive, remember, communicate, distinguish truth from falsehood, or appreciate the duty to tell the truth in court.</p>
            <dir>
                <p align="justify">(a) <i>Proof of necessity</i>. -  A party seeking a competency examination must present proof of necessity of competency examination. The age of the child by itself is not a sufficient basis for a competency examination.</p>
                <p align="justify">(b) <i>Burden of proof</i>. -  To rebut the presumption of competence enjoyed by a child, the burden of proof lies on the party challenging his competence.</p>
                <p align="justify">(c) <i>Persons allowed at competency examination</i>. Only the following are allowed to attend a competency examination:</p>
                <dir>
                    <p align="justify">(1) The judge and necessary court personnel;</p>

                <p align="justify">(d) <i>Conduct of examination</i>. -  Examination of a child as to his competence shall be conducted only by the judge. Counsel for the parties, however, can submit questions to the judge that he may, in his discretion, ask the child.</p>
                <p align="justify">(e) <i>Developmentally appropriate questions</i>. -  The questions asked at the competency examination shall be appropriate to the age and developmental level of the child; shall not be related to the issues at trial; and shall focus on the ability of the child to remember, communicate, distinguish between truth and falsehood, and appreciate the duty to testify truthfully.</p>
                <p align="justify">(f) <i>Continuing duty to assess competence</i>. -  The court has the duty of continuously assessing the competence of the child throughout his testimony.</p>
            </dir>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 7. <i>Oath or affirmation</i>.</b> -  Before testifying, a child shall take an oath or affirmation to tell the truth.</p>

            <p align="justify"><b>Section 9. <i>Interpreter for child</i>.</b> - </p>
            <dir>
                <p align="justify">(a) When a child does not understand the English or Filipino language or is unable to communicate in said languages due to his developmental level, fear, shyness, disability, or other similar reason, an interpreter whom the child can understand and who understands the child may be appointed by the court, motu proprio or upon motion, to interpret for the child.</p>
                <p align="justify">(b) If a witness or member of the family of the child is the only person who can serve as an interpreter for the child, he shall not be disqualified and may serve as the interpreter of the child. The interpreter, however, who is also a witness, shall testify ahead of the child.</p>
                <p align="justify">(c) An interpreter shall take an oath or affirmation to make a true and accurate interpretation.</p>
            </dir>

            <dir>
                <p align="justify">(a) The court may, motu proprio or upon motion, appoint a facilitator if it determines that the child is unable to understand or respond to questions asked. The facilitator may be a child psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, guidance counselor, teacher, religious leader, parent, or relative.</p>
                <p align="justify">(b) If the court appoints a facilitator, the respective counsels for the parties shall pose questions to the child only through the facilitator. The questions shall either be in the words used by counsel or, if the child is not likely to understand the same, in words that are comprehensible to the child and which convey the meaning intended by counsel.</p>
                <p align="justify">(c) The facilitator shall take an oath or affirmation to pose questions to the child according to the meaning intended by counsel.</p>
            </dir>

                    <p align="justify">(2) One of the support persons may accompany the child to the witness stand, provided the support person does not completely obscure the child from the view of the opposing party, judge, or hearing officer.</p>

                </dir>
                <p align="justify">(b) If the support person chosen by the child is also a witness, the court may disapprove the choice if it is sufficiently established that the attendance of the support person during the testimony of the child would pose a substantial risk of influencing or affecting the content of the testimony of the child.</p>
                <p align="justify">(c) If the support person who is also a witness is allowed by the court, his testimony shall be presented ahead of the testimony of the child.</p>
            </dir>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 12. <i>Waiting area for child witnesses</i>.</b> -  The courts are encouraged to provide a waiting area for children that is separate from waiting areas used by other persons. The waiting area for children should be furnished so as to make a child comfortable.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 13. <i>Courtroom environment</i>.</b> -  To create a more comfortable environment for the child, the court may, in its discretion, direct and supervise the location, movement and deportment of all persons in the courtroom including the parties, their counsel, child, witnesses, support persons, guardian ad litem, facilitator, and court personnel. The child may be allowed to testify from a place other than the witness chair. The witness chair or other place from which the child testifies may be turned to facilitate his testimony but the opposing party and his counsel must have a frontal or profile view of the child during the testimony of the child. The witness chair or other place from which the child testifies may also be rearranged to allow the child to see the opposing party and his counsel, if he chooses to look at them, without turning his body or leaving the witness stand. The judge need not wear his judicial robe.</p>
            <p align="justify">Nothing in this section or any other provision of law, except official in-court identification provisions, shall be construed to require a child to look at the accused.</p>
            <p align="justify">Accommodations for the child under this section need not be supported by a finding of trauma to the child.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 14. <i>Testimony during appropriate hours</i>.</b> -  The court may order that the testimony of the child should be taken during a time of day when the child is well-rested.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 15. <i>Recess during testimony</i>.</b> - </p>
            <p align="justify">The child may be allowed reasonable periods of relief while undergoing direct, cross, re-direct, and re-cross examinations as often as necessary depending on his developmental level. </p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 16. <i>Testimonial aids</i>.</b> -  The court shall permit a child to use dolls, anatomically-correct dolls, puppets, drawings, mannequins, or any other appropriate demonstrative device to assist him in his testimony.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 17. <i>Emotional security item</i>.</b> -  While testifying, a child shall be allowed to have an item of his own choosing such as a blanket, toy, or doll.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 18. <i>Approaching the witness</i>.</b> -  The court may prohibit a counsel from approaching a child if it appears that the child is fearful of or intimidated by the counsel.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 19. <i>Mode of questioning</i>.</b> -  The court shall exercise control over the questioning of children so as to (1) facilitate the ascertainment of the truth, (2) ensure that questions are stated in a form appropriate to the developmental level of the child, (3) protect children from harassment or undue embarrassment, and (4) avoid waste of time.</p>
            <p align="justify">The court may allow the child witness to testify in a narrative form.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 20. <i>Leading questions</i>.</b> -  The court may allow leading questions in all stages of examination of a child if the same will further the interests of justice.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 21. <i>Objections to questions</i>.</b> -  Objections to questions should be couched in a manner so as not to mislead, confuse, frighten, or intimidate the child.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 22. <i>Corroboration</i>.</b> -  Corroboration shall not be required of a testimony of a child. His testimony, if credible by itself, shall be sufficient to support a finding of fact, conclusion, or judgment subject to the standard of proof required in criminal and non-criminal cases.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 23. <i>Excluding the public</i>.</b> -  When a child testifies, the court may order the exclusion from the courtroom of all persons, including members of the press, who do not have a direct interest in the case. Such an order may be made to protect the right to privacy of the child or if the court determines on the record that requiring the child to testify in open court would cause psychological harm to him, hinder the ascertainment of truth, or result in his inability to effectively communicate due to embarrassment, fear, or timidity. In making its order, the court shall consider the developmental level of the child, the nature of the crime, the nature of his testimony regarding the crime, his relationship to the accused and to persons attending the trial, his desires, and the interests of his parents or legal guardian. The court may, motu proprio, exclude the public from the courtroom if the evidence to be produced during trial is of such character as to be offensive to decency or public morals. The court may also, on motion of the accused, exclude the public from trial, except court personnel and the counsel of the parties.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 24. <i>Persons prohibited from entering and leaving courtroom</i>.</b> -  The court may order that persons attending the trial shall not enter or leave the courtroom during the testimony of the child.</p>
            <p align="justify"><b>Section 25. <i>Live-link television testimony in criminal cases where the child is a victim or a witness</i>.</b> - </p>
            <dir>
                <p align="justify">(a) The prosecutor, counsel or the guardian ad litem may apply for an order that the testimony of the child be taken in a room outside the courtroom and be televised to the courtroom by live-link television.</p>
                <p align="justify">Before the guardian ad litem applies for an order under this section, he shall consult the prosecutor or counsel and shall defer to the judgment of the prosecutor or counsel regarding the necessity of applying for an order. In case the guardian ad ltiem is convinced that the decision of the prosecutor or counsel not to apply will cause the child serious emotional trauma, he himself may apply for the order.</p>
                <p align="justify">The person seeking such an order shall apply at least five (5) days before the trial date, unless the court finds on the record that the need for such an order was not reasonably foreseeable.</p>
                <p align="justify">(b) The court may motu proprio hear and determine, with notice to the parties, the need for taking the testimony of the child through live-link television.</p>
                <p align="justify">(c) The judge may question the child in chambers, or in some comfortable place other than the courtroom, in the presence of the support person, guardian ad litem, prosecutor, and counsel for the parties.
