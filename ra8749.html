                        amounts which will significantly contribute to the non-attainment or will interfere with the
                        maintenance by the Department of any such ambient air quality standard required to be included
                        in the implementation plan to prevent significant deterioration of air quality or to protect

                of the application of the fines, the PAB shall prepare a fine rating system to adjust the maximum fine
                based on the violator's ability to pay, degree of willfulness, degree of negligence, history of
                noncompliance and degree of recalcitrance: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> That in

                testing center shall establish a roadside inspection system. Should it be shown that there was no
                violation of emission standards, the vehicle shall be immediately released. Otherwise, a testing result
                indicating an exceedance of the emission standards would warrant the continuing custody of the impounded
                vehicle unless the appropriate penalties are fully paid, and the license plate is surrendered to the
                DOTC pending the fulfillment of the undertaking by the owner/operator of the motor vehicle to make the
                necessary repairs so as to comply with the standards. A pass shall herein be issued by the DOTC to

                accredited to conduct vehicle emissions testing and apprehensions shall undergo a mandatory training on
                emission standards and regulations. For this purpose, the Department, together with the DOTC, DTI, DOST,
                Philippine National Police (PNP) and other concerned agencies and private entities shall design a
                training program.<br><br>SEC. 47. <span style="font-style: italic;">Fines and Penalties for Violations of Other Provisions in the Act</span>.

                in the litigation of the case. Gross violation shall mean: (a) three (3) or more specific offenses
                within a period of one (1) year; (b) three (3) or more specific offenses within three (3) consecutive
                years; (c) blatant disregard of the orders of the PAB, such as but not limited to the breaking of seal,
